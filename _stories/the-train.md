The horn whirred and the scene around Hannah grinded to a halt.   

“You have twenty-five minutes. And whatever you do, do *not* take any longer.” The conductor’s voice rang through the speakers. His voice sounded plain, monotone almost, like he had done this a hundred times.   

Hannah signaled to the three others—two young men and one young woman—to come along with her. They needed to find it, not being totally sure what *it* was.   

“This one is a lot worse,” said Teddy, “look at that.”   

Hannah turned on her flashlight and tried to focus her eyes forward along the path. She was never good at seeing far ahead in the dark, and as she aged this only became more difficult.   

“I don’t have the footwear for this.” Sighed Kate, dressed in Birkenstocks and white socks.   

The trail ahead was rocky and sandy, surrounded by thirsty trees, like what you’d find on a New Mexico hiking trail. *Was this New Mexico?* Hannah didn’t know when or where the train started. All she knew was they were here to find something. The trail went upwards, steep, no flatter than a seventy-percent grade. It was cold and dry, but the night had an electricity to it, a tension that comes just before a thunderstorm. Maybe it was cloudy; Hannah looked up but could see no stars, nor a moon. *When was the last time I saw stars?*   

The rest were already making their way up the steep hill. It was chilling being alone, even if she still had the light from the train windows illuminating her. Wind pulling her forward, she thought about the comfort the train brought, that the artificial light—civilization—brought. The wind picked up, and she realized if she waited any longer, she wouldn’t be able to see her group. She inhaled, used her free hand to smooth back her ponytail, and jogged over to the hill. Crunching pebbles beneath her, hearing the bits of sand grating against each other, she finally reached her group.   

“How much more hill could there be?” Hannah panted.   

“What a place to let us off.” Peter shined his flashlight to one side, peering into the dark abyss of trees.   

Hannah didn’t remember where they were last let off, only that for some reason, this place was worse. She didn’t know what they were looking for, yet she felt no urge to ask.   

When they reached the top of the hill, Hannah saw something approaching through the darkness. Nothing in her felt afraid, just curious. She could sense the others noticed the presence as well.  

“A dog?” Kate shined her flashlight onto what looked like a husky-German shepherd mix. 

The dog stopped approaching, its attention locked on the ground. Eyes shot back and forth between the group, and they unanimously decided to investigate, no vocal confirmation required.   

Sounds of sniffing and plastic crinkling filled the air.   

“Is it eating?” Peter said.   

“Oreos.” Said Teddy.   

“Don’t Oreos have chocolate?” Kate pushed Teddy to the side to get a better look.   

Hannah panicked slightly and forced her way towards the dog. She grabbed the Oreo container, noticing it was now empty, and flung it away, into the blackness. “They’re gone.”   

The dog breathed heavily and looked up at the group. Hannah could see its eyes darken, focusing in on them.   

“What’s that?” Kate’s voice became low.   

The dog’s mouth was frothing.   

“We have to get out of here.” Teddy grabbed Hannah’s forearm and started running.   

*What time did we have to be back? How long have we been here?*   

Hannah’s thoughts were interrupted by artificial light. *Civilization.* A cul-de-sac seemingly cropped up out of nowhere, a few decrepit Victorian homes, but only one with its   lights on. 

A drawer thudded shut. Hannah opened her eyes to daylight streaming through her window, the feel of a soft blanket brushed up to her cheek. She looked up to see her partner, John, getting dressed.
