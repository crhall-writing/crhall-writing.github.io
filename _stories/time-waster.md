The splash was crisp on my cheeks. Water bubbled from the dingy faucet, and I watched it stream into the dark; the drain was uncovered, gaping enough to feel a cold draft under my chin. The sink was worn and porcelain, much like the girl who would walk in here after me. I lifted my head to look at the tiled, tagged walls, a single lightbulb hanging from a chain over me; a low sepia glow from the fixture wasn’t in this case comforting, but instead sickly. I looked in the small, scratched mirror, at my reflection barely visible, but what caught my attention was the enormous shadow cast behind me, still in its place as I was. It suddenly became obvious how much colder it was in this bathroom, isolated and exposed, in comparison with the outside—or *inside—* with patrons dense like pudding; warm and amalgamated, a monolith until last call would be announced. 

The muffled sounds of voices filtered in and were morphed and stretched yet neither torn nor redone by my filter—the one which spun my head and wobbled my legs. I thought about my place in this small box. *How was I to get back?* But I had already decided I no longer had a place there and had been ready to go for some time. This place didn’t need to be somewhere I had to escape, but there was only so long I’d be able to get by here, to mooch food off another strange man who bore awfully close resemblance to some real man from my real life. *Real life.* What, now, did that term even mean? Was this place real in the way I knew, or something different? 

With that, I hit my elbow on the door. *Yowch*. I was far too gone to even have a reaction to that and went back to staring into the scratches and smudges above the sink, trying through them to catch a glimpse of my hair—flattened by the dry and cold but now beginning to frizz due to the countless breaths in the main room. I wet my hand and used the water to tame fraying strands. I more gracefully undid the latch and used my shoulder to push the door open, a wave of humidity welcoming me back into civilization. 

It took me some moments of pushing through the clientele—a few friends seated with more friends looming over from behind, still able to huddle together and hear each other even with a group of six, seven, or eight. I got up to the counter and used it for a kind of balance. *I’m going to be sick.* I removed my coat for some relief and set it on the back of a chair beside me. Head swirling, my eyes would go out of and come back into focus, and suddenly I wasn’t aware of nor cared about the people around me. The soft sound of guitar floated into and around my ears, and every so often I’d hear a word, and connect it with an object I’d see in front of me. *Kismet.*

“Twisted mouths,” I heard her softly wail, as my eyes met a beautiful person’s face with a mangled set of teeth, lingering smears of pink surrounding their chin and chapped lips. “Who will pay,” she proclaimed, my attention zeroing in on a pair of calloused, dark hands removing a tattered bill from his blanched and cracked wallet. 

“You gotta stop that.” My thoughts were suddenly interrupted by a voice so close it seemed like it couldn’t have come from outside of my own head. I stared forward, not seeing anything but a homogenous crowd. Movement appeared in my periphery and there he stood, tall, young, and so reductively handsome he wasn’t at all attractive. No facial hair was present, not even stubble, with thick and straight locks from his head only long enough to slightly hang over downturned eyes. Something in his eyes felt incredibly distant, empty, as if there was no one there behind them. I couldn’t make out the color, trying a few times yet being overcome by nausea due to the coat of smoked and spat tobacco along with a dank mildew I’d only smelled during basement concerts in college. Keeping some space between myself and my focus seemed to help avoid the vomit-preceding heat on the tongue. 

I didn’t reply—not from lack of something to say, but from indecision on *what* to say. Without warning my face was hot, my lips forming a small frown and my eyes brimmed with tears. 

“I told ya—*stop.*” 

I involuntarily exhaled due to an unexpected pat on my back. Despite being sudden and forceful, the feeling of another hand was comforting in that moment. It became apparent that the guitar was still being played, though it was awfully difficult to remember to listen for it. There was hesitation in the way his hand was held up—I didn’t need to look directly at him to sense it—but this only lasted a few beats before he dropped his arm to his side. I blinked one tear that rolled down my cheek—nothing more came out—and my vision was clearer, yet still not fully there. He was looking down on me, his back facing to the dim light which helped me not with making out the color of his eyes. My inability to distinguish made me frustrated, and then I felt closed in, almost panicked by the lack of space. “What are you talking about?”

His eyes disappeared behind his hair momentarily when he gave a small shake of his head. He cleared his throat. “The secret to coming here is—” he tilted his torso, pressing his arm to my shoulder, his eyes looking straight ahead, not at me, “they never have enough ice here for yer stuff.” He used one arm to show me a martini glass, and I supposed I had only viewed until then his other hand. *Did I want any more to drink*, I thought, as he nudged the glass to my chest. The small sip I took made me gag. It was as warm in feel as it was offensive in taste. “You wanna get the mixin’ stuff—Old Tom.”  

“Old Tom’s?”

“Is it yer first?”

“First what?”

He already had a bartender’s attention and pointed at me with his free hand. “Get her a martini—maybe a couple’a splashes of vermouth. Old-fashioned—Old Tom, yeah,” he pointed vaguely to the counter.  

It was hard to make out anything aside from a large, bright set of teeth contrasting against the bartender’s mustache, far darker than the streets outside, which were illuminated by nothing more than rows of sparse and flickering lamps and the lights of a handful of streetcars still in commission. “I’ve told you a million times, we don’t have vermouth.” 

“Cinzano, then—fine.” Breath exhaled. 

“And she knows it’s sweet?” Eyebrows raised. 

“Does she look particular?” Hand opened, gesturing. 

The bartender shrugged and with that, bent over behind the bar.

 Another exhale, and he tilted his head towards me. “Point is, when the gin’s anything but cold, and I mean *ice *cold, it’s a shit drink. The juniper wrestles with yer mouth and throat and it’s always this losin’ battle.” His pointer finger jutted out from his glass-wielding hand and my eyes followed its movements. “You’re gonna be whipped by the flavor and not in any kin’a good way. So, Old Tom.”

“Why not ask for more ice?” I peered towards the glass door on the far side of the bar, frost forming at the edges. A streetcar’s headlight illuminated tracks left in the fresh powder.  

“They’ve always got ice everywhere ‘cept this damn place.” After throwing a hand up, his eyes followed mine to the door and remained there when I looked back to him. “Don’t know what’s stoppin’ this guy from walkin’ out the door and pickin’ it up off the street.” 

“I can hear you,” the bartender’s voice could be heard, himself still being invisible behind the wood. He popped up, bottle in one hand. “I told you; we’re waiting on the delivery.” 

“And ya say that every time.” 

“And you leave before it comes every time.” The bartender poured clear liquid followed by a caramel one straight into a fogged glass.

“This night’s different.” 

All I heard then was a small cough as the bartender slid the glass along the counter; I was surprised it didn’t topple over as it ran over the grooves and pores of the wood. With half-lidded eyes I attempted a polite smile which came out more as a slight purse of the lips. Once my fingers touched the room-temperature glass, the bartender’s appearance became murkier, masked by haze as he stepped farther away to perform some other duty upon which I cared not to speculate. 

“No matter what ya do,” he leaned over, so his head was now level with mine, “you’ll never be able to stop it.” 

My eyebrows furrowed and I finally got a look into his eyes. I wasn’t thinking about his eye color anymore, though. I was too focused on holding my drink steady. 

His rather emotionless face became uncanny as he finally let out a small smile. “Or slow ‘er down.” 

I closed my eyes once again and opened them now to see crows’ feet surrounding his eyes, once again keeping me from noticing the color. The smell of tobacco was replaced by the smell of marijuana—someone must’ve stepped into the place just then. Taking a deep breath in, sweet and familiar skunk entered my nose, and I thought certain indeterminate notes were different from what I’d expect from the scent; I let my eyes wander, seeing an even fuller bar. At some point the live guitar stopped, and now some faint recording of *Layla* was playing. 

Anyone who’d seen me would’ve surely thought I was under some type of intense influence. And I supposed I was. I was moved by the martini glass in my hand, the man with—*longer?*—brown hair, the smells of our surroundings changing as fast as my mind could keep up with the fast-paced dialogue escaping his mouth. I felt already that I could listen to it forever and never become tired. I took a sizable inhale over my drink, surprising myself with an unexpected fume which too made me gag as the taste of my new companion’s drink had moments ago. That sensory experience made me perkier for this moment. “What are you talking about?” 

He didn’t answer, instead focusing out the door which had before captured my attention. 

*Is it snowing harder now?* Though I couldn’t see any snowflakes fall, the streetcar tracks were covered by an undisturbed white blanket. 

“They’ve still got no ice in ‘ere.” He ran a hand through his shoulder-length hair. *No way was it that long before.* “Ya might as well drink it like that.” He looked down to my glass-in-hand. “No point in waitin’ for it to come.” 

“I wasn’t waiting.”

“You are. You always are.” 

I leaned back, away from him, and glanced around once more. Too many small things were different, but those things were, to be fair, too small to fully understand. Hairstyles were different; something about the colors of clothes, the fabrics, the way the outfits came together. “What is this?” I asked, not bringing my attention back to him but instead keeping my eyes on the crowds. 

“Here’s the thing,” he patted my shoulder in a harsh, flinch-inducing manner. Again, he awkwardly raised his hand, then took it back, hesitating before putting it to his side. “No one’s gonna be waitin’ for ya.” 

I looked forward still, only having heard his words float over one cheek. 

“No one’s gonna give ya any trophy.” I looked to him this time. “No one’s ever gotten one for this.” 

“For what?” 

“Smoke?”

“Huh?”

He reached into his coat pocket and took out a pack of Winstons. Once he got one in his mouth he gestured the open box towards me with a slight hum that escaped around his cigarette. 

I shook my head. 

“You know when ya know.” 

“Know what?”

“Ya got a light?”

I smiled, that frustrated smile that I tried to cover with a frown, making my face contort and the smile even more obvious to any observers. I shook my head. “I don’t do that.”

“Have ya done it?” 

I met his eyes and with wry smile said, “Sure I have.” *I hadn’t*.

“Well, why not *now*? Again?” 

I was now staring at him, my focus fading in and out, eyes again half-lidded, a rush of adrenaline and relaxation fighting for dominance. I shrugged.  

“So, come now,” he motioned towards two now-empty bar seats we’d been surrounding. I followed his lead after he took a seat. He rested an elbow up on his knee and outstretched his hand towards me. “Put yer mouth up fer me and try this ‘ere.” 

The raising of his eyebrows gave away how visible my own expression was. *So gross,* I thought. But I shifted my weight forward, forming my lips around the cigarette.

“There ya go,” he whispered and reached back into his coat pocket as I balanced it in my mouth. “Keep it right there fer me.” He pushed a lighter into my face and flicked it a few times before it caught. “You know how to pull, don’t ya?” 

“I’ve pulled more than a cigarette.” 

His arm in its awkward position moved slightly with his laugh. “Alright then. Show me how it’s done.” 

Taking the cigarette in my fingers, I scrunched my face and braced myself. I remembered how I coughed, and coughed, and coughed after taking my first hit of a joint. *I looked ridiculous. Don’t do that.* I inhaled deeply—too deeply—and coughed, and coughed, and coughed. *Damn it.* I set my drink down on the counter.

“Alright. Alright.” He took the cigarette away and gave me a few pats on the back; I could feel even his palms mocking me. “I get it. What were ya pullin’ before? Freight trains?” 

I cleared my throat, but when I tried to speak, my voice immediately cracked. *God.*

“It’s ‘kay, kiddo.” Though he smiled, it stopped at his eyes. He was focused on the front door. 

“I think something weird’s going on.” I finally managed to croak out. 

He didn’t look at me, furrowing his eyebrows. “I mean, I guess it’s snowin’ in October.” I saw his smile fade when he looked back to me. “‘s that what you mean?” His eyes seemed to droop at the sides even more than before; it gave some appearance of sadness, maybe brought on by the oncoming winter, maybe from some other thing. 

I still didn’t know what I meant. Something weird *was* happening, but I wasn’t entirely sure of what. It wasn’t anything obvious—nothing I could grasp or no reason I should scream; just an ambiguous layer of *odd* that draped the humid room. “Nothing, I guess.” 

“You guess?” 

I looked towards him, focusing on his dark hair, how thick the strands were. A man of his age is lucky to still have a head of hair like that. He made me feel intimidated. I thought if I had been younger, I might’ve wanted something from him. He was the type of person you’d want to show off to your acquaintances, to get some type of validation that you must be as attractive as he is, otherwise why else would he hang around you? But all I wanted from him was the comfort he brought. The companionship. The shield he seemed to provide against whatever unease I felt. I was too occupied with these thoughts to answer. 

“You’ve gotta pick one or the other.” 

That halted my thoughts. “Huh?” 

“Forward or backward—we both know which it’ll be.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“You’ll have to decide, there.” I felt his hand once again pat my back. I looked at his face, his eyes closed, almost like he was bracing himself for something I would not understand. The lighting in the room must’ve changed, as his hair seemed lighter, gray strands becoming more visible, the frayed ones taking majority over the silk that hung neatly onto his shoulders. It seemed almost as if it was shorter now. 

I must’ve been staring too intently at his hair—he raised one brow, the lines in his forehead more pronounced than ever in the heightened fluorescence of the light above us. 

“What is it? Never seen a guy wanna dance?” As his smile formed, I noticed the skin at the corners of his mouth gathered in ripples. Someone I originally thought was around my age now seemed to be maybe fifteen or more years older. 

“Dance?” It was then I could hear an entirely different type of music flood the bar. Gated reverb was all I could process surely, otherwise paying attention to other instrumentation was futile. My wrist was clasped by his hand and eventually I was pulled towards the center of the room, passing by a patron who coughed directly onto me. *Nice*.

I didn’t know much about what to do with myself—I was overwhelmed by perfumes and caked makeup; large, frizzed hair and mullets hung down onto combinations of leather and denim, blue and black and black and blue, red lips everywhere between. I swayed to whatever rhythm the songs demanded, and my focus seemed to go in and out at a similar pace. Eventually I got pushed into my happenstance partner, my chest to his, and on some other night I might have felt a type of excitement or wondered if he were feeling it too; tonight was evidently not like most nights. 

“Do ya wanna go?” His thumb pointed towards a gap in the crowd, showing a clear view of the glass door, and through it streetlights—brighter now—and an empty snow-cloaked street. 

I shook my head. *No.* I didn’t even think about what he meant or where we would go, as if some bodily instinct gave me the answer.  

“Ya can’t stay in ‘ere forever.” I felt his hand on my back, and it did not this time drop to his side. I neither felt threatened nor flushed, only comforted by his touch. 

“Why not?” I looked up at him, but he kept his eyes on the front door. My eyes lingered on his face—a layer of skin drooped along his jaw ever so slightly, and he again had a look in his eyes that was empty and void yet carried the shape of despair. 

“Yer barely dancing.” His face turned back to mine, and he looked down on me with what I could only gather was pity. 

“I don’t want to leave tonight.” I wasn’t sure what pushed me to say that, and I scrunched my face at my own words—sure, the feeling of his hand on my back comforted me, but he was just another stranger. A particularly strange one, at that. 

“I told ya,” he took his other hand and put it to my chin, then up my cheek, then through my hair on the side of my head, “ya gotta make a decision.” He took his hand out of my hair and gave a firm pat to my shoulder. 

There was a strong smell of exhaust that hit me with haste. I watched through the front door and saw a small car struggling to maneuver over the ice but eventually it got traction, leaving behind a plume of gray. My attention returned and I could see him still looking down on me, one hand had moved from my back and the other remained on my shoulder. His jowls were more prevalent in whatever this light was, and his hair was a mix of salt and pepper, salt overwhelmingly dominating. He looked so very tired, the bags below his eyes obvious and the red of his tear ducts preventing me from looking at either iris directly. The sight of him now made me feel a sense of grief, of missing or mourning for something too distant to pinpoint. There was a loss in his face, like seeing a creek having drained and become barren. My lashes again felt the presence of my tears, and I looked away, my eyes betraying me and not finding anything on which to focus, and his hand met mine; after a short bout of gripping and palming my fingers were intertwined with his. 

“They’re callin’ it soon.” He looked to the bar, now a few rows of people away from us. “Let’s get ya another.” Although he pulled my hand with him, I stayed still, keeping my feet planted where they were. 

“I’m not thirsty.” I spoke quietly, barely above a whisper—for some reason or another my voice was nearly shot. Maybe it was the Winston; maybe it was something floating in the near-winter air. 

 “So... what? Ya hungry?” For the first time he appeared surprised. 

“Will you come with me?” I showed him finally my eyes brimmed and wet. 

“Where?” 

“Out there.” I nodded my head and looked at the door. 

“No.” And what a plain way he spoke. 

I gripped his hand with more force and knew my face had become redder. I felt his grip loosen until his hand was limp. “What? What happened?”

“I can’t give it to ya.” He gave a smile that told me he was sorry; his sunken eyes still gave nothing of meaning to me. 

“Give me what?” I grabbed his free hand in mine, keeping a tight hold on the other. 

“What yer tryna get.” 

Something gave way, and what was left of me drizzled down my cheeks. “I’m trying to give *you*—” I looked down at my shirt, “—if you’d just—*let me!*” My attempt at some raise of my voice was a far cry from commanding, resulting in a cocktail of voice cracks and vocal quivers. I brought his hands to my hips and to my blouse. When I met his gaze and he wasn’t looking at me, instead past me. His face was becoming full of wrinkles that I tried to ignore until now. This made me desperate to have him *see* me—to know that when he saw me it affected him. Without thinking I began to unbutton my shirt.  

“Ya don’t need’a do that.” He turned his head away. 

I stopped unbuttoning my shirt and grabbed his collar, pulling him towards me, to face me. “Can I please just kiss you?” 

He shrugged and bent down to meet me where I was and against mine were a trembling pair of chapped, dry lips, as I grabbed his leathery face. His lips were unremarkably rough and loose, cold, even. There was no taste of pleasure or of suffering; I imagined that this is how kissing a corpse must feel. I pulled away from this old man and felt nothing inside—nothing had been gained and nothing had been lost. 

“Do anything fer ya?” Again, what a plain way to speak. 

My eyes went in and out of focus, tears blurring my vision. I stared straight ahead, hunched over in defeat of nothing I could articulate. 

“I’ll take that any day. But I ain’t listening ‘til ya got somethin’a say.” 

“I don’t know what you want me to say.” I frowned, enduring similar sensations in my stomach and head present in faint memories of childhood. 

 “Then go out there an’ find somethin’.” He turned to the front door. 

I stared where he watched. There was a huddle of bundles of coats and hats and mittens walking past the front door, right outside. Another worked to unlock a rusted bicycle from a nearby light post. I exhaled, surprising myself by the amount of air I’d held in my lungs for so long. I looked back to him, pale and shriveled. He jutted his chin out again towards the door and I wondered if his jaw would crumble from that only. I nodded and began to cut through the crowd similarly to how I’ve whacked through tall weeds in the summertime. It felt in ways that a lifetime had gone by passing between shoulders, and then I reached the frosty glass door. I looked back and saw the old man, watching as I left, too far away now to make out the color of his eyes. 

The bitter wind pinched my cheeks and flowed through my blouse. I buttoned up the few notches I had undone while inside as I took small steps onto the salted sidewalk. My sleeve brushed against another. 

“Oh I’m—wow, aren’t you cold?” Two large, bright eyes were waiting for me when I took mine off my blouse. She had a warmth and life in the way her features worked together that made me completely forget my frozen disposition. I smiled, face still puffy from tears spent and ice already replacing the streaks down my cheeks and nose. 

*My coat.* I took a breath in. “I left something in there; I need to just—” I stuck my hand out and hurriedly shuffled back to the door. When I stepped back in, the bar had only a few older patrons, hunched along the counter. I spotted my coat on the chair next to the bar and nodded to a different bartender than the one from earlier. I looked back to where I last spotted the old man, seeing nothing but an empty floor and a grandfather clock against the wall. In dark brown wood there were carved finials and columns alongside masterful fretwork, the hands hovering near one. I stepped forward to see the clock in a clearer light, to see it under the warm glow of a lamp—dusty and cracked and filled with various dark spots on its bulb—to see the hands tick with the sound that seemed to echo from some other place, to see *something* that could give me what I had been needing all night, to see the color on its face, to see the color—

Green.
