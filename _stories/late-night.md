The lingering wine behind your eyes is now mixing with the black coffee pushed to the far side of your linoleum table. You’re tapping your foot, trying to get some inspiration from the reflection in the black liquid but you’re instead feeling a beat, beat, beat mixed with the drums of the classic rock track and—black, drip and flat and spread out on the off-white surface. The textures scatter under the translucent spill and your attention goes over to the corners that have seen better days, weeks, and years. It’s fresh in how stale it is.  

And that spill shows a reflection of the poster up to your left—“GIVE ME A REAR END—WITH SOME MEAT ON IT”. Your brows jut in and you squint and focus back on the keyboard a little less far to the left. *What*—*I*—*never mind*. Maybe it’s the absurdity of the hour, the rush of caffeine, the French fries in your stomach—and again, the leftover wine buzzing in your veins, in your ears, amplifying the Elvis record which now is at this overwhelming yet overtly well volume. Put down the coffee, you think to yourself, but then again, stay here all night—order every single greased-up item on that damn menu. Who’s going to come here to intrude? But you feel the thump, thump, thump start in your heart and something’s going to give. Now, it’s like you’ve been possessed again for the first time in what feels like ages. You can taste the bitter black on your tongue and that’s all you need now; you take a moment away from the page to use your napkin and pick up that spilled liquid.  

And there’s this groove in you—a groove that matches the blues blasting from the 90’s AV setup propped up on the corner against red and white checkered tile. It feels like it can’t be broken—the faint strings in the backing of the track bring up something deep in your gut and before it escapes you fully, you’re whipped into the upbeat jumps and head bops commanded by the luscious screech of James Brown’s growling voice.  

Suddenly then you feel paralyzed, sat in wait while you’re taken on some journey of 50’s wa-wa heartbreak and one of the few patrons at the booth behind you goes, *Wa-wa* in some jovial high voice, and you wonder. Not about anything in particular—your open eyes don’t need anything in mind.  

And suddenly, that sixth sense kicks in—the one telling you someone’s watching. There is. He’s lowered his head, leaning towards your booth—empty across from you save for your backpack—and you’ve now got two dark eyes staring into your own. Something’s got to give, else the stare’s just going to hold, like some taught rope daring to snap. You’ve never been the best at croaking out a word when you’ve been given no time to think of an opener. You feel the rope stretch even more.  

“Someone sitting here?” He smiles—his unnaturally large forehead didn’t distract much from his familiarity, or maybe it drew attention to it; you didn’t know yet. *Yet*. And your thoughts skip to the acknowledgement that there simply is no *yet* with a total stranger. But your eyes subtly shift to the row of three large windows facing the lot outside, being transformed by the illuminated interior into a mirror—almost every stool at the bar is open, and only two of the four booths are taken—including yours. It appears *yet* is a word that should top your vocabulary after all.  

You clear your throat as he’s already on his way to sit across from you—*My bag*—you try as well as you can to gracefully slide out from your bench, but you don’t work well without a plan. You move forward and awkwardly pierce your chest with the table’s blunt, tattered edge and in reaction your lower back thuds against the bench’s back. “Sorry, uh—my bag’s in the way.”  

He's already pushed it to the side. *Duh*. With tightened lips you look back to your laptop, now the only thing standing between you and some dreaded new social interaction. You’re irritated now that you can’t focus on it—the spell of the speakers above wore off and now you’d need to find some way to enter back into that state. You can’t even pinpoint who’s singing the current song. Without realizing, your diaphragm collapses into an audible release of air.  

“Late night?”  

You look up at him once more, and he’s made no attempt at busying himself or pretending at that. A nod must do, you tell yourself, and he’d be on his way.  

“I don’t bite,” from your periphery you catch an impression of his hands resting on the surface, one hand laying over the other, flat. And moving ever so slightly to the right, you see a jewel pasted onto a silver ring, wrapped around the top hand’s index finger. The jewel was emerald, glistening, and as clearly fake as it was large. But that shade of green was the same as was the sea all those years past—and now your periphery is fuzzed while your ears buzz and you become green-faced in the same way as you were all those years past.  

And if you’d just tilt your head a bit, you’d see the lot just beyond the windows is now an ocean, and you’re just drifting on it—getting sick—in your seat. The lighthouse out there glows and the halo is now staring you down.  

“What do you mean by—” the closing of your laptop is like a diving board, and you sense the waves picking up beneath you as you jump; “—bite?”  

“Why would anyone bite?” He shakes his head and coolly looks to the bar.  

“I don’t know—I’m really—” Careful now. Don’t let your insides go. “—I’m really tired.”  

“I am too.” His pupils are growing into two massive storm clouds—black against the grey of his irises. The black outside the window is even blacker atop a storming sea waiting to drag both of us down into a never-ending abyss.  

You let out another involuntary exhale, and you’re irritated—so fucking irritated—“What are you doing here then?”  

“I’d ask you the same question.”  

Beat. Beat. Beat. And you’re sucked back into the grounded nature of the diner—the seasickness gone, you once again feel the pulse of the newest song flooding between the booths.  

“You have nowhere else to go—” he takes the liberty of using his bejeweled hand to push your closed laptop off to the side. “I know you don’t.”
