We waited in the cold winter air, one girl evidently just got out of a late-night shower. She examined her hair, stiff now to her touch, and though she would regret it she pawed at it until it broke, baseless strands now falling into her hand. 

I felt a nudge on my back. 

“Do you know what’s happening?” 

I turned around and saw a woman, looking exactly her presumed age—18 or 19 years old, just as the rest of us were. She had a round, tanned face and noticeably dark eyelashes and straight, brown hair that was tousled, a victim to whatever tossing and turning would be warranted from our building’s radiators obeying only one temperature: *hot. *

“Did someone pull it this time?” 

I smiled politely, awkwardly, not knowing what to say yet since I was still coming to from the disturbance of my normal cycle of tossing and turning.

“Hey,” with the back of her hand she gave a light swing at my arm. “Did you hear me?” 

I blinked and wiped my forehead. “Oh, yeah, uh—” I looked to and fro trying to catch a glimpse of anything that would clue me in on what the deal is *this *time. Not a single part of the crowd stood out to me except this woman and a blonde beauty in both a towel and shambles over her impromptu haircut. “I really don’t know.” 

The sound of her long, drawn-out exhale told me she was just as annoyed as I was; I was just trying to tolerate the cold out here until I could get back into my boiling dorm. Both places were equally as unpleasant in my mind. And hey, at least I could look at this woman in front of me; she wasn’t exactly difficult on my eyes.

“Did they ever tell *you *what’s going on with these?” I then gave into my pacifier and again looked at her; I tried my best to avoid looking anywhere below her nose, thinking I might be obvious even if I looked at her lips. I didn’t want her to think I was *that *kind of guy, and more so, I didn’t want to *be *that kind of guy. But all this thinking about it, made me think about *it, *and now I could feel heat falling below my torso. *Damn it. *

“No. I never know if it’s a drill or—” I looked up to avoid her eyes, “—or whatever.” I folded my arms at my chest, trying to give them something to do. 

“Are you cold?” My eyes darted back and I saw that she, too, had arms folded. Though mine were against my chest neatly, the size of her, well, *chest, *made it hard for her form to be as neat as mine. I was lucky the air was so far below freezing, it gave me some type of sobriety when I noticed the stretching of her shirt, the way her cardigan hung on either side, open, giving full view to the lack of any support underneath such a thin and stretched t-shirt. How was it so easy to notice these details, and so heavily difficult to know what the text printed across the front spelled? 

“Me? Oh, no, not really.” I pleaded with my eyes to focus on something else—anything else—for if she knew what I had been looking at or what feelings I was feeling I’m sure I’d die of embarrassment. At least that’s what it felt like, in that moment. 

“But it’s so cold out here.” *Oh, don’t come any closer, please. No, no, no. *I felt her arm slightly brush mine; either I must’ve without realizing leaned closer to her or she had done it to me. 

“Yep.” I gave a slight tightening of my lips. Why did I feel like both as a prisoner and as a guard out in the open air, held captive by a woman who seemed genuinely interested in giving me this attention? I knew deep down it was what she wanted to do, and yet it still felt entirely my fault, as if I in some indiscernible way was an aggressor holding her down. I cleared my throat. 

“Do you know when we’ll go back in?” She looked up at me with doughy eyes, her eyebrows slightly raised. 

I shrugged. “I usually just follow the crowd back in.” I was now focused on how imperfectly her eyes were shaped—one was far larger than the other. I noticed her nose, more bulbous than what I imagined the shape of a woman’s was to be. Though, come to think of it, I don’t think until then I had noticed these things in people. I certainly never noticed the lopsidedness of my roommate’s cheeks, nor the unwieldy hairs on my geology professor’s grey eyebrows, nor the bentness of my brother’s nose, never fully healed from the time he face-planted on the mat during a wrestling practice in his high school days. 

She smiled, her slightly crooked teeth now apparent. “What if the crowd is wrong?” 

“They probably are.” Somehow I felt a bit more at ease, no longer seeing her as a captive, nor as a captor, but instead as some flawed being who might want something from me. I wasn’t sure yet if I wanted to give anything; I wasn’t even sure if I enjoyed the attention. I thought momentarily and decided my best course of action was probably to let it be and not give anything she may or may not be wanting. I am so young and there’s so much to do, especially right now. 

“So why would you follow them?” she leaned just the slightest bit more into me, and despite the primal excitement I felt rushing through my arms, hands, and other places, I also felt this noise of agitation that buzzed through my ears, making my jaw tense and causing me to stand straighter, hoping this would throw more space between us two.

“I don’t know—” I scratched my head. “I guess they never tell us why the alarm went off anyway, and it’s not like they’re gonna come out here and tell all of us. Someone at the front’s probably been told and knows and then people back here would just go in, too.”  I exhaled harder than usual, seeing a cloud of white emit from my lips into the crisp air. “I mean, it’s so fucking cold out here.” 

“I thought you weren’t cold.” Her eyes lit up and it only made the rot of my mood more fragrant. *Why does she think I’ll find her funny? *

We were interrupted by shuffling feet all around, by bumping and reorganizing and murmurs individually so soft but together an amplified cacophony. 

“So, here we go? Right?” She sung with a voice that now sounded so unbearably shrill and nasal. 

I gave a nod and only a small glance out of politeness, for this ordeal was nearly done. I was desperate to get back into my dorm, to see nothing but the absence of my roommate who had gone home for the weekend, his mark left by discarded clothes draped over chairs and unmissed plastic cups he’d stolen from the dining hall.

After some time moving forward towards the dorm in loose formation, the front door was finally in sight. *No fire**; **no real emergency. Some dumbass pulled the alarm… again. *I smirked in some sense of victory, having predicted what is so predictable. I let out a small laugh through just my nose and tilted my head towards her, my eyes still stuck on the entrance ahead. “See? Just another guy pulling a prank. No need to wait on someone to come get us.” 

After a few beats of silence, I looked over and saw a new stranger standing where she once stood. I raised my eyebrows and looked around, unsure of when I lost her in the crowd. Through two heads I could see her with three other guys, just having pulled away from a hug with one of them. She made large gestures, her message to them I could not distinguish, but whatever it was made them laugh. Suddenly I couldn’t remember the deficiencies of her features nor the jarring nature of her voice—from here it sounded musical—and I had this sudden feeling that she will be one that I will write home of from this day forward. She is now immortalized as the muse who got away from me, her eyes so perfectly unique and nose like no other’s. Anyone who is to hear her voice should think themselves lucky, and the words she says should be taken ever so seriously. I imagined what life could have been like had I had more courage, to do what it is men do, and it was then that I realized why men go to war.
