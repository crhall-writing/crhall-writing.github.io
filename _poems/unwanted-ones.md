you can’t be enough  
for those who like you too much  
and never quite simple  
for those who like you too little  

always some unwanted one  
beating at my door  
and I pretend I’m not home  
lest he ask even more  

and yet the only one I remember  
is long, long gone now  
vanished like September  
with tears of snow trickling down
