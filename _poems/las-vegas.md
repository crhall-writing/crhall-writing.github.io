the sequins fall off  
their glue melted in the car   
as did the red lipstick  
the one that never matched your tone  
and as you walk off the stage  
you’d get snatched by the arm  
and reprimanded for the extension  
the blonde clump that never matched your shade  
and your heel bleeds   
but it can’t be seen, thank god  
against a black tap shoe   
and you shake and tremble  
from caffeine, overexertion, fear  
one of them or all three, but no time  
to think on that, take a half-eaten snack  
from the red-haired lady’s purse   
and her black nail polish takes you back  
to a few weeks earlier in the dressing room  
seeing a pin stabbed with haste through a girl’s ear  
and you don’t remember what the screams sounded like  
just that the blood matched the lady’s hair, and the contacts  
the ones they’d only have a minute twenty seconds to get in   
during the costume change between the numbers  
and your muscle spasms relax and now it’s just you  
and the pain of that tight ponytail, glistening, unmoving  
encased in hairspray to which you’re allergic   
but you won’t know until you’re older  
not everyone lives with bloodied feet and burning scalp  
and an ever-lasting addiction to adrenaline
