blue light flickers in the dark  
and the shag carpet runs  
between my tiny toes  
I remember all the little games  
the way those thick, fuzzy blankets  
felt every day and every night spent  
over at yours or over at mine  
and the day I saw you move there  
we were both too shy to speak  
but my mother had no filter, luckily  
and we were about the same age  
and you had cousins and I a brother   
who would soon be best of friends  
we’d make movies and I’d write scripts  
and we all believed in each other  
and then came the last day  
I remember my bike in the cul-de-sac  
the one I’ve now not seen in twelve years  
I was fourteen then and speaking as though  
I’d mapped out the rest of my life  
with big dreams and big plans and the like  
and no wonder  
we don’t speak anymore  
I never stopped  
and asked about yours
