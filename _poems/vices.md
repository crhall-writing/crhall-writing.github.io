white clouds stirred  
contrasted against the black  
the warm against the cold  
and just like that, it unfolds  

but we thought we could keep  
everything tightly wound  
forever our knuckles white  
over sounds of brand new fights  

why is it now, we get along so well  
like two deflated balloons    
each of us holding our favorite vice  
wine in one and joint in other  

a few weeks ago we agreed   
weâ€™d quit what tears us apart  
but here we are, finally together  
maybe these will save us
