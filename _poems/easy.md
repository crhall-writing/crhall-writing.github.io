we like her, being so easy to understand  

her hair, even when she jokes of how messy it may be  
is neater than the neatest another might see  

her smile, always warm and familiar  
as it looks like every other near to her  

her free time is unneeded  
for she’s content with pleasing through the weekend  

and her grief is simple and welcomed  
since it would never cause discomfort to anyone
