to the girl who goes, 7am  
to the gym and listens  
to everything on my mind.  

to the girl who takes it all  
so seriously, never pretending  
she knows what I go through  

yet somehow knows so much more  
than the next person   
who wants to feel involved  
or validated or as if   
they look like someone good  

to the girl who puts it all  
into perspective I rarely have  

how much is constantly   
on my shoulders, never  
exacerbating or making it  
all about her. and even   
with all of that acknowledgement  
she still makes me part of her world  

lets me listen to her problems  
and give the advice I love to give  
never fearing I can’t handle it.   

it takes a real girls girl  
to take care of you  
while making you feel  
that you’re taking care of her
