why is it now

that achievements stop being admirable

when someone you don’t admire achieves?

<br>

why is it now

you call this the meaning of your life

then drop it the instant you are outrun?

<br>

why is it now

devotion is required ‘til I devote

then suddenly I am too serious?

<br>

why is it now

angels take themselves lightly 

yet my resting is lacking severity?

<br>

why is it now

your virtues abandoned when challenged

you shield your eyes and call it wisdom?

<br>

why is it now

you lack the courage to believe what you do

against the men you know will uplift you?

<br>

why is it now

the lies do ring true; a sponge

sucking the life from all who are near?

<br>

why is it now

you borrow every voice for your argument

never a word from your own mind?

<br>

why is it now 

you decree what is or isn’t art

when you cannot make it yourself?

<br>

why is it now

that I don’t look up

at you in that tall and stoney tower?

<br>

why is it now

rules you declare vanish

the very moment they apply to you?

<br>

why is it now

you tell me I’m lesser, won’t meet my eyes

because I felt more than you ever could?
