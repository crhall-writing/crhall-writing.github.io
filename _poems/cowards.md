why is it now  
that achievements stop being admirable  
when someone you don’t admire achieves?  

why is it now  
you call this the meaning of your life  
then drop it the instant you are outrun?  

why is it now  
devotion is required ‘til I devote  
then suddenly I am too serious?  

why is it now  
angels take themselves lightly   
yet my resting is lacking severity?  

why is it now  
your virtues abandoned when challenged  
you shield your eyes and call it wisdom?  

why is it now  
you lack the courage to believe what you do  
against the men you know will uplift you?  

why is it now  
the lies do ring true; a sponge  
sucking the life from all who are near?  

why is it now  
you borrow every voice for your argument  
never a word from your own mind?  

why is it now  
you decree what is or isn’t art  
when you cannot make it yourself?  

why is it now  
that I don’t look up  
at you in that tall and stoney tower?  

why is it now  
rules you declare vanish  
the very moment they apply to you?  

why is it now  
you tell me I’m lesser, won’t meet my eyes  
because I felt more than you ever could?
