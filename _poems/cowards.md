Why is it now

That achievements stop being admirable

When someone you don’t admire achieves?

<br>

Why is it now

You call this the meaning of your life

Then drop it the instant you are outrun?

<br>

Why is it now

Devotion is required ‘til I devote

Then suddenly I am too serious?

<br>

Why is it now

Angels take themselves lightly 

Yet my resting is lacking severity?

<br>

Why is it now

Your virtues abandoned when challenged

You shield your eyes and call it wisdom?

<br>

Why is it now

You lack the courage to believe what you do

Against the men you know will uplift you?

<br>

Why is it now

The lies do ring true; a sponge

Sucking the life from all who are near?

<br>

Why is it now

You borrow every voice for your argument

Never a word from your own mind?

<br>

Why is it now 

You decree what is or isn’t art

When you cannot make it yourself?

<br>

Why is it now

That I don’t look up

At you in that tall and stoney tower?

<br>

Why is it now

Rules you declare vanish

The very moment they apply to you?

<br>

Why is it now

You tell me I’m lesser, won’t meet my eyes

Because I felt more than you ever could?
