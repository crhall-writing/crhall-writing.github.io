imagine yourself double-aged  
then none of this is charming  
anymore  

the pride you feel from using  
the entitlement cloaked as uniqueness  
the spitting down projected as  
protection from spitting up  

eventually you find  
not a single soul    
cares enough   
to look up  
when the muscles required  
are dwindling  
the skin around our eyes  
is sagging  

we can’t hold our liquor  
like we used to  
and there’s nothing to you  
when they’re sober
