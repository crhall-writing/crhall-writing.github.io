I miss you already, though you're just up the stairs  
your footsteps uneven, in that same beat you bear  
the off-kilter rhythm, so certain, not neat  
from the rods in your legs to the nails in your feet  

bolts of lightning and metal once held you in fastened  
and somehow that pain became strength now that's lasted  
like the brother of your father the earth had just known  
we needed you hear to see the newest iPhone  

like the hair on your lip, your skin never thins  
no ankle that twists, no back that bends in  
I smile when things tumble--I know what's to come  
you'll lift them and laugh with your weird emerald thumb  

and with every small loss, like the professor in Paris  
was another fry shared on the couch that can share us  
c'est tout ce qui compte--the rest fades away  
every lost love is a story to say  

don't shave that mustache--they'll believe you're 16  
and maybe you'll stop knowing the things that I mean  
part of me wonders where all time could go  
once "pap smear" can roll of the tongue that I know  

but you don't have to spell it, to always belong  
you're loved just the same through short words and long  
I'm eager to meet him, the boy who'll one day  
make me shield my eyes to his truck-driving ways  

wherever you wander, wherever I loll  
some part will always be there in our hall  
in the fight room unused, in the stairwells of wood  
with life feeling as wonderful as life ever could
