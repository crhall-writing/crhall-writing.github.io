remember that little packed bar  
the night I met you in Burlington?  
how I said I’d already been too long  
and should’ve left that night anyway  
and I’d already cancelled  
seeing my friend in Connecticut  
to get a few more days up north  
after climbing Mt. Washington?  
and you said it’d be quick  
we could just talk a little longer  
you wanted to hear more  
and I could never say no to you  
it was obvious from the get-go  
and I always laugh when I remember  
I hadn’t had a shower in three days  
and I asked if you noticed  
the smell of my hair  
and you smiled and said of course  
I could always shower at your place  
that tiny little loft, neatly occupied  
by little knick-knacks and evidence  
of all the short films where you act  
and write, and to me  
there couldn’t be anything more impressive  
and I kissed you, long before I got to showering  
and somehow found a way  
making various excuses for remote work  
to stay with you five more days  
and all the apple orchards and covered bridges  
and art hop, I still have my little postcard we bought  
and all the visits and the plans for the next ones  
and then they told me I needed to take a trip  
and another, and another, and another  
and I got busy, and it became so obvious  
I had no plans to remain in the east  
and just as the sun rises near you  
it’ll set in the west   
but every now and then    
I see the moon we’ll always both have  
and wonder what could have been
