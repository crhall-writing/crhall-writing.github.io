waterloo  
feeling the way that I always do  
you sat down across from me  
didn’t think much of it, but eventually  
we’re laughing along with our friends  
and each time I’m wondering where I’ll end  
up I’m somehow tied up next to you  
and along with each fact I give you conclude  
I’m the coolest person you’ve ever met  
and with every interest I’d usually forget  
you say it’s your number one obsession  
and at the end of the night I made no suggestion  
I guess you didn’t either  
I was so desperate to see you  
again. I know that I will next week  
but how do I contain my need to know of how you feel for me?  
I suppose I’ll find out  
but right now I want to scream and shout  
to the world, that I met someone like you  
I didn’t know it’d ever be true  

but you know, maybe that self doubt kicks in  
where I think I’ll never be enough for him  
he’s someone I look up to, needing no notes  
and I’m so used to the ones that don’t  
even know how to act while out  
like I’ve got to protect everyone else from their snout  
never sensing the vibe in the right kind of way  
and always stressing for the next thing they'd say  
this one I trust  
and I think it’s reason enough  
to think he deserves better  
and I’m moving, this can’t be forever
