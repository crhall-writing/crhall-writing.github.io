you’d think it was a skyline  
a forgotten city   
that forgot to switch off the power     
orange ornaments decorate tall pillars  
and in your periphery they appear like pyres  
turning one poison into a new poison  
so long as they achieve a boiling point  
and you suppose the plumes rising above  
carry more than just economics
