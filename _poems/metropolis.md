you’d think it was a skyline  
a forgotten city   
forgot to turn off the electricity   
orange orbs decorating the tall pillars  
and in your periphery they appear as pyres  
turning one poison into a new poison  
so long as they achieve a boiling point  
and you suppose the plumes rising above  
carry more than just economics
