not too long ago I was sleeping so well  
I don’t know exactly what’s the problem  

well  

maybe it’s the state of the world  
my friends getting pepper sprayed  
where I told them to remain   
all I could say was “stay safe”  

maybe it’s needing to keep my distance  
while keeping others near  
who don’t understand why I need  
to keep that space between  

maybe it’s the copious amounts of caffein  
I already know I can survive without it  
I went five years, no doubt about it  
but coffee is so good and life is so short  

but I’m starting to think  
maybe I just enjoy being awake  
getting to see so much and learn so much  
I feel like I’d miss out after eight  

hours  

the clock’s ticking  
and I’m an expert at wasting time  
but I love every minute I waste  
I don’t thin I have to feel guilty for it anymore
