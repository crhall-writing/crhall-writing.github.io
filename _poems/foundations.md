I  
am   
here    
I’m sitting  
and thinking  
why is holding on   
something I still do?  
please for hooded eyes  
please, just one more time  
one more time, I will say now  
knowing I will never get enough  
always wanting more, and asking  
please look in my eyes like old times  
could you tell me I’m small all the same  
and tell me I should always take the blame   
I’ve come to miss those little games we play  
it’s as though everything builds more with time  
the imaginations we have become wilder and wild  
you become taller, wittier, and kinder within my mind  
took years of building and building, laying there stones  
that were always knocked over where we’d be eye to eye  
but now I don’t have you here to observe, now just a mould   
I can use to fit to my every wish and my ever-reaching desires  
you’re not a person to me—just some idea, now, and how strange  
how strange it is to paste idealism onto those you never even valued  
those times in the past, those times you had every chance, in your face  
you’d scream at them until you realize, until you really look into the mirror  
how can you expect to build a foundation when you started at the very top?
