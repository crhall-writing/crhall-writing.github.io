you wouldn’t know what to do  
or how to be   
without these things  
to sing or to write or to drink  
in spite of what morning brings  
and maybe one day you’ll see  
you can chase those big dreams  
the ones that seem to contradict  
what it may be that she asks of you  
and maybe if what she needed   
was something that could be achieved  
but you know it’s not, that she’s got  
issues upon issues she hasn’t worked through  
and for whatever reason it’s on you  
the one always to keep up her ruse  
and one day I’ll be away from it all  
and I’ll get the chance, big or small  
to live, be, and create without fault
