I laugh along with my friends  
and we nod and act like I deserved better  
and I did, oh boy do I know I did  
I deserved someone who wanted me  
who would’ve taken me to the emergency room  
instead of making me drive myself  
or to urgent care  
instead of making me drive myself  
or along to the golf course  
instead of having me pass time in your house   
by myself  
but for what you had on hand  
I’d never think you didn’t try  
but I was never, ever your type  
and we both know that   
and hell, I don’t think you were ever mine  
but you took that time  
to frame that drawing I’d discarded  
even though it was never finished  
you told me it deserved a home anyway   
and in ways, I was never good enough  
and you also weren’t good enough for me  
but I could never lie and try to imply  
that alone you were anything   
less than as perfect a person could be
