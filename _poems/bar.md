if I'd never felt lonely  
I suppose I'd never have gone with you   

to that bar underneath Santa Fe  
and let you order for me    
the most peated scotch  
that'll ever assault my tongue  
almost as striking  
as your eyes lingering when I coughed   

you're the type of guy  
that made me realize hours after dusk   
it's my sunglasses still on  
making the drive to leave you so difficult  

but back when we ate breakfast before dawn  
you told me about the fans begging  
for you to restart your music career  
I knew as soon as you started it wasn't true  
but it was clear to me    
we had more in common than you'd think
