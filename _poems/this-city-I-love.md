in this city I love  
the bridge is coming down  

in this city I love  
the doctors are barred out  

in this city I love  
the gunshot still rings loud  

in this city I love  
I gaze to the skyline, wondering how  

It could ever be the city I love  
and then they all surround  

candlelight warming the city I love  
even in winter they crowd  

together to protect this city I love
