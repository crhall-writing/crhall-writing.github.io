someone told me poetry helps to stop    
looping thoughts  
gives an exit for the roundabout way of my heart    
to shoot off and land wherever it wants  

my chest aches, tearing and winding and mangling   
whatever sits under that set of ribs   
I still remember how gigantic that mound felt against his   
breaking his bones to escape   

I’m not angry at myself   
it was like he came to me, guiding my sleep   
last night   
rushing through my body a warmth I’ve never known   
a peace that can only stem from such extreme   
grief   

seeing every bit of him, inside and out   
for so much time, so many days and nights   
from treatment in rochester   
weeks spent driving hours at a time   
staying in grimy motels   
salty parking lots    
the ring of the bell when he was all done   
him still insisting on using his cane   
then slowly needing a walker   
and quickly needing a wheelchair   

I can’t remember the last time I heard his voice   
I remember he got the hang of it at some point   
talking with that big golf ball thing in his mouth   
a graft taken from his thigh  
but one day his voice went away    
never to be heard again   

it became just a tiny gurgle   
deep and powerful but so quiet   
demanding and in such hefty pain   
but so quiet   

until it was gone   
his little body   
once a behemoth frightening me as a child   
then just a hollowed form     
where so much more had once been   

I’ll miss him for the rest of my life   
I’m not angry anymore  
I just ask anything that could exist, that’s ever existed   
please, please, show me a ghost   
please, let something be out there   
that could let me see my dear friend again   
I haven’t heard my favorite voice in so much time   
a year and a half without his tongue   
a year and a half since he sat with me and talked   
a year and a half since he drank a martini   
so incredibly together with me   
a year and a half fucking wasted as he wasted away   
unable to eat or taste food  
or hug me without worrying about his trach tube   

I say I’m not angry, maybe you can tell that’s a lie   
a lie in some world where honesty can’t save you   
but it can make him proud   
so I’m going to try to be more honest   
and do what I think I should, do what I think is right   
because that’s who he always was
