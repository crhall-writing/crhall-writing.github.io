he had given me poison so raw  
I cannot even ruminate on it enough  
to write evocative words that can pass along  
the same pain that makes me shake  
like I’d die of frostbite when all my adrenaline    
has been used up  

but I am no longer sad  
I no longer despair  
I no longer doubt my own reality  
I’m free to be whoever I may be  
for I’ve finally stood up to my greatest bully
