you’ve tried your hardest   
to make me go spelunking  
with no hard hat  

the cave will be there   
if I leave for my equipment  
I won’t go without it  

you can paint me as weak  
you can paint me as rigid  
you can say I’m a perfectionist  

I will not go into a cave  
without what spelunkers say  
is necessary to be safe
