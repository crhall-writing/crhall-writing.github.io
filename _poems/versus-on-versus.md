how strange is the feeling

to have given up

on falling in love

or on finding it appealing

<br>

I thought that, yes, becoming whole

would mark the right time

it's no longer mine

I'm now happier alone

<br>

I fear everyone around

will look with pity

"she was so pretty

under her tears she'll be drowned"

<br>

but away I wept those tears

I am now become

like an emptied drum

how could I go on for fifty years

<br>

I recall through watered eye

I said I'm empty

I am so empty

"but I want more", he cried

<br>

but at least you're not alone

how do they not know

all the things you will owe

just for the sake of being owned

<br>

and being empty feels free

nothing you can use

nothing I can lose

and nothing will return to me

<br>

how could I possibly have beared

to never see grass

turn frozen at last

nor be burned by the freezing air

<br>

I now breathe at 10,000 feet

though the air is thin

when I take it in

nothing has ever smelled so sweet

<br>

was it a way to be filled? 

have someone inside

it'll stop your mind

who cares if the self is killed

<br>

I remember you would talk

when I was thinking

and my heart sinking 

you didn't need to hear my thoughts

<br>

now not a thought incomplete

I'm living in sin

my hair whipped in wind

I'm high up at 10,000 feet

<br>

I love the cold wind, you see

how you accept it

how you respect it

else it brings you to your knees

<br>

I loved how I'd make you laugh

though now how I try

to recall your eyes

I miss splitting meals in half

<br>

had I been anything more

than a distraction

excuse for action

or for filling some vacant drawer

<br>

you could've filled it with clothes

tee shirts of players

names and name-sayers 

or socks with five little toes

<br>

no amount of love-making

could ever make love

worthy to give up

Everything that you were taking

<br>

love is not biology

though my body begs

for someone's DNA 

to be shoved deep inside of me

<br>

"happy mom you'll never make"

her words were vivid 

and I was livid

but she was right for rightness' sake

<br>

"you'd raise my children so well"

his words were fluid 

what if I do it

how special it made me feel

<br>

please sacrifice your art for me

you are not that good

at painting on wood

it's just one more drop in the sea

<br>

please surrender your light for me

you're no Fred Astaire

you've children to bear

it's just one more drop in the sea

<br>

what will this ever bring to me?

her breasts too saggy

stomach too flabby

this isn't the girl you married

<br>

what will this ever bring to me?

she's not like before

not fit anymore

this isn't the girl you married

<br>

what will this ever bring to me? 

two hours of sleep

that's all that she needs

this isn't the girl you married

<br>

what will this ever bring to me?

she's now so angry

don't shake the baby

this isn't the girl you married

<br>

what will this ever bring to me? 

children eyes blue

freckles you can view

why else would you want to marry? 

<br>

what if it's born without eyes

with skin falling off?

is it still enough

to give up the rest of your life? 

<br>

I'm one of a kind, you'd say

but soon you forget

the moment you've met

a girl with better DNA

<br>

you thought you had optimized

a brain so complex

performance in sex

and yet no need to ask why

<br>

have we not both seen plenty

to see it repeat

fate's waiting to meet

what comes out at age twenty

<br>

stumbling upon again

body limp and grey

hell've a drug, they'll say

routine for a La Quinta Inn

<br>

what if I, rather, come upon

a child so perfect

it's me they reject

how would I ever go on?

<br>

does the idea still make blood

rush down to your thighs

where you're circumcised

and pool 'til you've let out the flood?

<br>

what if it fails to relieve?

the moments before

they often mean more

than after you've spread all your seed
