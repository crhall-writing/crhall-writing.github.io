I once knew one who wrote such wondrous prose  
in lush greens and branches that dreams  
only could hold, such glamour, as  
the whole world was technically righteous  
and well-read and childless.  
yes, he produced the effect of years  
of discipline from reading the words of others,  
mimicking every trick he’d seen from another,  
an apprentice promised to be a master.  
but I never cared much for that;    
for what are words woven together  
to give you nothing to have?  
are regurgitations of patterns of grammar  
anything when they don’t cause great discomfort  
or a bed for someone who’s never truly slept?  

somehow, and I never read a lick of this,  
I thought someday you’d write something I’d read,  
that we both would explain through smokey, blacked-out streets  
on sticky summer nights or violent winter spites  
that maybe God came to us through the ugliness of life.  
I waited for you to come through the haze  
and tell me my waiting wasn’t in vain  
but at the end of the long and winding road  
there was only me  
waiting to show all my current prophecies  
and how wrong they’d be  
and standing so tall, though without having grown,  
with hand outstretched to my shoulder it lay,  
things are better off this way.
