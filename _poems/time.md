they say a serial killer’s profession   
is most likely to be a truck driver;   

some people might focus on the fact that   
they can go unnoticed passing by   
state lines, like a fly in a beehive,   

doing whatever dirty work they need to get done.     
yeah, no, I don’t care for that part.   
but I think to myself, driving through dark,   

they must have so much time   

for the disposal, cleanup, whatever act itself.   
it’s so fucked to live in a society   
where you’re so strapped for time   
and privacy.
