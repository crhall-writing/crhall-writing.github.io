we refuse to see, to look  
at those details, big and small  
that could derail the life w built  
whether the wood was solid or rot  

I think a lot about this  
I keep finding myself in   
another ethical dilemma  
am I an enabler, tugging them on?  

if I'd abanoned ship long ago  
would the passengers parished  
or would they have escaped in time  
before the oil fire swallowd them?   

and now so much to correct    
to stop before it spreads     
and all the others I've let  
make do with the distractions
