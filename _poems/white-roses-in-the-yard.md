“I was gifted this perfume,” I said, pressing my wrist to my upper lip  
“what is it?”  
“it doesn’t say; just some name without a description.” I held out my arm  
signaling her to come take a whiff  
“oh—wow.” she raised her head, then went back for one more, deeper this time    
“right? I think it’s just like fresh flowers”  

but that wasn’t the full story  
suddenly I was back in the unkempt, dry grass, calves destined to itch  
but not quit yet   
as I picked the juvenile white drift roses off the bush, each time  
peeling every one down to the bud  
the way I used to chew my nails down to their raw, soaked beds  

and then I was in a field at sunset with J   
taking pictures of one another, like that was our job   
instead of the ones we wanted to escape   
dreaming of life as so much more than it is   

his hair had just grown back, remission of four months   
and two months earlier, bald-headed J and I went to Santa Fe   
and I gave his dad a copy of Luca Turin’s guide to perfumes   
and his dad cried as he always did, a sharp hug ensued    
one that could only be shared between a man who loves men   
and a woman who secretly loves women   
both who spilled their souls on pages like they were all that could hold   
the enormous weight of two people like us   

and I blink and look at the cashier, telling her it’ll be a long night in the hospital   
after she asks if I’ve plans for a fun Halloween   
and she tells me to give her a moment to find something   
I’m cursing myself for oversharing to an innocent worker   
and she comes back with a bouquet, the smell of which I’ll never forget   
telling me it’s on her, and that she’s been there before   

“I think I’m more of a dessert scent gal, truth be told,” she replies back to me  
and I smile, retracting my arm, wondering what desserts meant to her
