in aisle 12 of the grocery store

I remember the patterned outfit

I thought I saw it more

than would've been coincidence

<br>

I know nothing about you

no last, middle, or first

and yet I can't help but intrude

or bump the wall with my purse

<br>

I can be so confident

called a maneater

but how I'm such a mess

every moment I see her

<br>

I know it'll be gone soon

I can't daydream forever

I'll never really know you

and we'll never be together

<br>

but you looked at me

and this time I didn't look past

how lovely it would be 

to know your name at last

<br>

but I'll just be here my pen in hand

and you'll be wherever you are

and I know you'll never understand

I lost forever getting in my car
