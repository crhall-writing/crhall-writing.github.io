in the tide pools of Malibu  
the dead anemones float  
she tells you to look up  
through the salty mist  
at the mansion by the sea  
it was her grandfather’s  
she tells you with pride  
way back in the days  
when he ran Kodak  
and you smile, moving on  
feeling the sand crabs  
trying to reach the surface  
every time  
the tide returns to sea  

and whenever you might catch  
glimpse of a dolphin passing   
beneath a wave  
you wonder if it was even that  
you listened to the stories she told  
of how every girl in every film  
you would hold in memory  
that it was you, just forgotten  
being too young to remember   
and you grow old and it lingers  
the memory of the dolphin  
living in your childhood tub  
the one   
that only she remembers   
and now you do too
