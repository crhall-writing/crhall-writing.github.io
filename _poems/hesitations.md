I think sometimes  
what terrifies me most  
isn’t failure itself  

but the fact that I  
can go weeks, months without a run  
and then do ten miles like it’s nothing  

or that the best writing I’ve done  
I don’t even remember how I did it  
or how I’ll ever recreate it  

and sure, I guess lots of us go through life  
relying on that kind of luck  

but what’s gonna happen  
when I’ve got no more muscle to rely on  
or the energy to make things I don’t  
care enough to remember  

I don’t deserve it  
and no one does  
who puts such little consequence  
to the aid from above
