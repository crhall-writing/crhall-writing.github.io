“what’ya gonna do?” he tapped the little white rod between his fingers. the ashes fell.   
“huh?” I adjusted, trying to prevent my back from becoming one with the rough oak.   
“you gonna just sit back, take your situation? give in to it?” he gestured to me,  
a tiny fire in his hand.   
the wind hummed past as I looked into the eyes of my situation  
and the trees dropped their own ashes down to us.
