saw that guy who used to walk with me to class  
from math club in college  
he learned how to wash his hair apparently  
and also learned how to organize appropriately  

we locked eyes at the meeting but had to leave  
no time for buddy-buddying when we’ve got shit to lead  

we’re making plans to knock door to door  
in the most colorful outfits possible  
to make our houses safe havens  
for our immediate neighbors  

because what a fucking dystopia this all is  
frey said stay inside if you want to stay alive  
‘cause god knows what the gestapo is waiting to do  
when they get to the rooms with no cameras  

they pushed a woman into a portal-potty the other day  
went in there with her  
how the hell do these responders control their anger  

this morning I saw the plane take off  
holding my 200mm feeling bad I couldn’t do as much  
as the guys with the 600’s, from getty one of ‘em  
talking about how he’s moderate-right but unable to survive  
in this place just like Germany in 1939 

they’ve started throwing tear gas and sting bombs at people  
at the gas station down the road  
busting windows and kidnapping in broad daylight  
crashing cars into onlookers who dare give justice a try  
I couldn’t go, I didn’t even know—I was at a damn organizing meeting  
all the while they’re going door to door asking for papers  
like the nazis they are  

and running food to the drive in need  
‘cause they’re cutting federal funds to the twin cities  

after all that getting home to see I’ve missed a call  
call back to find out family’s flying here tomorrow  
need to make a decision on how to cut tube feeding down  
up the meds to stop the tumors, maybe let him rest easy now  
sooner than later he got put on hospice too late, obviously  
but who the hell is able to tell when the right time is, anyway  

and now get a couple hours of writing in  
on a fucking dissertation I don’t want to finish  
get these papers to these colleagues  
about some dumb penguins  

and then go out, 11pm  
to make some noise at the hampton inn  
get those guys out of my city  
by any means necessary, even when the means ain’t pretty
