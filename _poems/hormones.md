your gaze searched and landed  
pupils dilated, light eyes  
are always so much more entrancing  
and there was meaning in that burst  
of a dozen different hormones  
which they’ve yet to fully illustrate   
in the journals that satisfy your hunger   
and you paint a life that is fuller than your means  
so long as you’ve conquered this it seems  
no one would doubt you ever again, surely not  
for you’ve gotten the prize they all want  
and the grass is truly greener when you need it to be  
the rain is sweeter so long as her figure keeps  
there is truth of life in choosing to be bred   

and that all sounds so mystical, like you might descend  
‘cause of how blitzed you got from fucking his girlfriend
