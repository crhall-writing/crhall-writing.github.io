“code delta” was all I could hear  
radio jolting me up  
“what the hell is code delta?”   
he didn’t have any idea  

any vertical part of my body  
would immediately fall ill  
so back down I laid  
“there’s been a breach on deck 4”  

“the hell you mean a breach?”  
“why weren’t we told”  
“we sent a code beta to you each”  
“no one’s been told about that code”   

it was go time  
this is what your training is for  
who cares if your stomach  
wants to jump out of its core  

you’ve got to keep moving  
but Ill lose my insides at once  
go to the bathroom, quick  
I’ll meet you out there when you’re done  

the ocean is so bright   
light bouncing off everything  
there’s no protection out here  
your nose will turn black if you let it  

either from sun or from the cold  
you people were not meant to be here  
why is that passenger outside on deck seven  
he’ll be blown away surely   

take him inside  
and listen to his rambled rants  
about how accents are ruining society  
listen to that English-sounding man
