I’ve never found a great way to describe guilt      
almost like a period cramp, deep inside      
close to the groin but definitely not pleasurable      
and a tightening of the chest, a raising of the shoulders     
a sense of dread that runs to the fingertips from the center      

and I wonder, how can I be more approachable?     
more patient, listen more, put up with more, be interested more?     
why was the only way out seemingly to blow up and say “fuck off?”     
to him, him, him, him, him, him, him, and, almost forgot, him too.     
is there something I’m doing, did they have a warrant to randomly do this?     

listen to this: I’m roped into going to a few things with a guy, friends of a visiting friend    
the entire time the new guy’s poking the bear, trying to get a reaction      
he’s changing the subject, interrupting, just to say he hates the pizza place     
I put on a list of 30 things for my friend to do,      
and we never even were going to go and chose to do the rest of the list anywho     
eventually I gotta yell at the guy, telling him    
“hey, it’s not my fault you’ve got a problem with things you’re not used to”     
him being a transplant and all that      
he said something like, “I don’t know if I should cry right now or what”    
expecting some type of pause and self admittance to being a bitch, right?     
I said to him, “you should cry—it builds character”     
he fell to an uncomfortable silence after that.     

then, I’m replaying it all again, wondering what I did to invite all of that      
wondering if I embarrassed myself in front of my friend    
wondering if I should’ve been more gentle, womanly, what the guy expected from me      

my thoughts are interrupted; I check my phone,     
the guy’s texted me asking me on a date now that my friends gone     
and we’re alone      

he got every opportunity to get away with it      
make me truly believe it was my fault      
but his dick couldn’t let him do that      

and what he helped me realize      
guys don’t show up, stick to you like glue      
insult you until you’re blue      
and ready to scream it all out      
if they’re innocent
