I’ve never found a great way to describe guilt      
almost like a period cramp, deep inside      
close to the groin but definitely not pleasurable      
and a tightening of the chest, a raising of the shoulders     
a sense of dread that runs to the fingertips from the deep center      

and I wonder, how can I be more approachable?     
more patient, listen more, put up with more, be interested more?     
why was the only way out seemingly to blow up and say “fuck off?”     
to him, him, him, him, him, him, him, and, almost forgot, him, too.     
is there something I’m doing, did they have a warrant to randomly do this?     

listen to this: I’m roped into going to a few things with a guy, friend of a visiting friend;    
the entire time the new guy’s poking the bear, trying to get a reaction--  

first he's telling me I should feel less human if I have no reaction to death  
when I said I didn't have any interest in watching some shooting of a neo-Nazi.  
I tell him, I'm caring for a hospice patient;  
you think I can be affected when death's staring straight at me on a daily basis? 


after the fifteenth time in two days, I tell him to fuck off.       
he says something like, “I don’t know if I should cry right now or what”    
expecting some type of pause and self admittance to being a bitch, right?     
I say to him, “you should cry—it builds character”     
he falls to an uncomfortable silence after that.     

then, I’m replaying it all again, wondering what I did to invite all of that--
wondering if I embarrassed myself in front of my friend,    
wondering if I should’ve been more gentle, womanly, what the guy expected from me.      

my thoughts are interrupted; I check my phone,     
the guy’s texted me asking me on a date now that my friend's gone     
and we’re alone.      

he got every opportunity to get away with it,           
but his dick couldn’t let him.  

and what he helped me realize is,      
guys don’t show up, stick to you like glue,      
insult you until you’re blue      
and ready to scream it all out      
if they’re innocent.
