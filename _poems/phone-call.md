you left the table  
telling me you needed to take a call  
and earlier you saw  
the one I missed from my friend  

so I made a call  
not thinking of it as   
something of my own  
more just a way to let you  
do what you needed to do  

and you came back  
not thirty seconds into mine  
saying you changed your mind  
and suddenly angry  
that I’d be so rude as to take a call at dinner
