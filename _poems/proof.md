there’s nothing more pitiful  
than the one so desperate  
for validation, that whatever  
they did had been right, all along  

that somehow deep down  
they’ll uncover something  
so special it’ll outdo  
all of the wrongs, all the long  

while, continuing the wrongs  
spreading them until they’re  
translucent--here, stretch them  
like dough to check the proof
