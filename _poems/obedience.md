he’s got thick, dark hair  
hanging down to shoulders  
carrying muscle from gyms  
and climbing and cooking  
and reading  
and watching  
and I like to think writing  
but the most special thing of all  
he did exactly what I told him  

and nothing could mean more  
than the way he willingly let go  
to do what’s best for us both
