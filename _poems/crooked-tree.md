oh, man, here they come  
tears on tears--each one  
underlining all I don’t know  
and should’ve learned so long ago  

I walk this path and land  
under trees I understand  
“why won’t they ever know me?”  
but truth is--I’m the crooked tree  

I’ve grown through barriers  
like pugs and bull terriers  
against all odds I grew  
but not enough for you  

or for others, at that  
and you’ve got my whole to pick at  
I wonder what keeps you here  
did you forget the wheel to steer?  

but the trees stare back  
I pull straps, tighten my pack  
oh, man, here they come  
but daylight breaks--I must move on
