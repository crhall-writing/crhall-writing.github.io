oh, very few of the hollywood beauties  
keep the admirers once they reach forty-three  
do you know how rare it must be  
to have a partner ask to have your ashes mixed, intertwined  

but it’s fine  
I suppose that’s just part of life  
dealing with the next guy  
or even gal just seeing you for the current youth  
you possess to please  

how unbelievably bleak   
how much you hate the hormones possessing  
keeping people so fine-tuned  
and so unaware of the whole   

I try as hard as I can  
to understand   
but I know most would immediately crack  
under, to me, what’s nothing at all
