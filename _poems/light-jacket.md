tiny snowflakes blipped against the dry  
just-under-freezing nigh. I held hands   
in my dark green pockets, knowing  
it’d be long before I saw their hue again.  

and the jacket I wore was light, the kind  
that you wear when you can’t admit  
summer’s gone. even when you love the cold  
you don’t want to let go, even when it’s time.  

you know they’ll rip the sky in two  
before admitting it’s finally through;  
it takes a great deal of courage and grit  
to stop holding your world and let it spin.  

and I saw an acceptance I’d never seen  
when I told her I’d be leaving next year;  
she said she might come visit the mountains--    
the first time she’d talked of life after him.
