block, fuck, get it done  
tobacco’s suffocating you  
in a dark lit room  
you’re not the only one  

why’s it now so hard  
before it easily came  
there’s a couple on a date  
I’m here without any spark   

maybe it’ll loop back  
the inspiration I felt  
maybe it can’t be helped  
maybe it’s the way I act  

God, why are they smoking  
what the hell kind of decorum   
exists ad memoriam   
while I’m sitting here choking
