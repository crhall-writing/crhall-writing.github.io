sometimes I feel like  
the weirdest people I know  
wanted to shine a spotlight   
to show that I’m alone  

and they got so angry   
when I was fulfilled without them  
they need me to come back, please  
how could I abandon him?  

I’m sorry the way you perceive me  
has nothing to do with reality  
I’m happy and proud and excited  
and I won’t live with your enforcement  

your hovering is, in fact, a burden  
I never asked for it  
if you’d take it away, already  
I can go get my things finished  

but you’ve looked at me  
as if you know I’d never be loved  
like I’m not grateful enough  
for the attention you give forcibly   

leave me alone already  
I don’t need you—I never did  
and if you don’t see them, then  
you’ll never be able to see me
