play along  
the first rule we got   
performing, you and me  
you and I swayed the same way  
a nervous habit   
facing the five onlookers  
in our little club of playing along  

and when he told me,   
“did you hear the news of Tony?”  
I played along   
you’ll never see twenty-three  
performing, just me   
nervous now that someone might find out  

when I first learned the news was true  
all I thought was, *I’m a better driver than you*
