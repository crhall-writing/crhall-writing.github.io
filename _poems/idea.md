I can’t believe I had the perfect idea  
and forgot it.   
I can’t believe  
that when running on sloppy streets  
feet threatening to freeze  
if I do anything but keep up the speed  

it flew away like leaves in the breeze.  

but I love this mind  
the one I am so lucky to possess  
just give it some time  
I’ll think up something better, I bet.
