mist hovers over lines  
like a slot machine  
yellow, black, yellow  
like beats, each match  
artefact-scattered transmissions  
guiding under ink-cased sky  
and you learn the pattern  
when to predict the next crackle  
from the radio, how many minutes  
until new blinding stabs, like two eyes  
taking out your own sight  
but you can make-do for a moment or two  
and, after sufficient track skips,  
the night relents its grip  
simply caressing your shoulders  
allowing them to slacken  
and as the deadening beams pass  
your breath gave your lungs no time to catch  
whether you know it or not  
the white splatter  
between your bumper and the infinity ahead  
appointed your verdict to a god’s
