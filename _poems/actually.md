"they're all of me"  
she said with astonishment  
and he looked down with disappointment  

he remembered back to before it all started  
she came in a blue cap and side ponytail  
offering something he'd always refuse  

and in the early days of complications  
he stopped her and asked for her mind  
but she had to leave and clear it  

and there was never an undo button  
maybe there was more to the story  
but the story must go on
