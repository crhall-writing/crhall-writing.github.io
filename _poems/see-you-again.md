maybe one day I’ll see you again  
and tell you all about these current events  
the new adventures  
they’ve pulled me aboard to experience  

I’d have you ride along with C and DJ  
go check out the daily spots  
tell you how to keep yourself safe  
while I strategize your route  

I like to think you’re the type  
who wants this slice of life  
to be part of history in the rawest way  
with blue collars laughing as we say  

how much each of us love one another  
so openly we embrace and come together  
these lifelong friends never judge  
you can say anything you want around us  

this eleven  
I like to think you’d fit right in  
if you ever came here I’d show you the ropes  
and all those “when-it’s-over” hopes
