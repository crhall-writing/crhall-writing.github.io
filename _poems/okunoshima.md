thousands of small ears perk  
witness to crashing waves  
and every now and then an approaching vessel  
carrying people eager to be approached  
to smile, to laugh, to throw their heads back  
and absorb the moss, the trees, and the beaming sun  
spilling over the sand throughout the day  
but when it retreats, behind the mountains facing east  
the ruins don’t stay perfectly still  
they vibrate with culpability   
and sway with the wind, scattering their ghosts  
where the golden light had briefly been  
they don’t dare leave the edges; there are no ears in the sea  
that will hear their pleas for forgiveness
