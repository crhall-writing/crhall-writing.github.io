it was snowing last Halloween  
the nurses in the hallway careened  
about the Halloween of ’91  
the great blizzard still getting buzz  

and here I am again now  
the exception to visiting hours  
a peculiarity to professionals  
a new life to me, to us all  

I’ve been up since 5 AM  
and on the way she said  
I should’ve been her daughter  
I am so much like her others  

the ones who rotate overnights  
keep our cool when it’s game time  
only break when given the OK  
in at least a dozen different ways   

there’s no time for tears  
too much energy is needed by fear  
you’ve got a day to save  
or at least that’s what they say  

a year ago I was sat in the same hospital  
though my home then was the neuro ward  
I became fluent in the ICU lingo  
and how little have things changed from a year ago  

there used to be heartache in the hope  
and you don’t realize how much handling goes  
and when it’s all run out  
every day is another day now   

I helped my cousin study for an exam today  
and she went on her merry way  
saying goodbye for me to spend this night awake  
and hundreds of milligrams caffeinate  

eight more hours turned to six  
when getting through the latest crisis  
and I thought it’d be the point I cried   
but he had the strength to give me the OK sign  

protect him from that red haired guy from respiratory   
And I’ve seen more than I’d ever thought I’d see  
from someone I never imagined with anatomy  
that is, until a year ago on Halloween  

we’ve got six more hours ’til morning rounds unfold  
and it hits me like dank water from the styrofoam I hold  
a year went by since things changed forever  
and I’m still in this hospital ’til November
