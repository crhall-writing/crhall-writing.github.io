you know, I get the same answer every time    
that there’s some secret scarcity of women     
and that’s why almost every man I’ve ever interacted with     
feels some need to ask me out  

when I know for a fact they don’t even like me  

why is that? last I checked there’s a roughly equal    
number of women to the number of men    

it’s almost like, if you’re a guy looking at a woman you hate  
thinking you need to own her, dominate    
dressed up as taking her on a date  

then the lack of women surrounding you isn’t just fate  
it’s almost like you suck balls or something
