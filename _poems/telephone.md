here—it’s a fun game, he told me.   
you’ll sit here, and I’ll sit there, and we’ll get the team   
on their own chairs, and then the advisor, the director, and the funder,   
like the father, son, and holy ghost   
will sit over by the stairs   
whisper in my ear why you think you’ve changed the world    
about all your dreams you’ve had since fourteen    
and as long as the next person who gets the message   
in their ear, as they half-pay attention,   
trusts it enough and so long as their buddy adjacent   
likes you to an extent,  

sure, the telephone line will morph and twist and bastardize   
that thing into smithereens, only if you’re in luck     
I guess it doesn’t matter if the world’s different or not
