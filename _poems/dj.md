will you ever really let me in?  
sometimes I feel like   
you’re the only, only one  
that could ever be for me  
my eyes might well  
the moment I think of you    
and you came here to visit  
and the whole time   
I just imagined  
you gone   

I’m sorry—so, so sorry  
I know you deserve  
so much better than me  
but I love you with a force  
that can’t be reckoned with  

the way you kissed me  
I miss it more than anything  
the way it felt having you   
sleeping next to me  
there’s no replacement for it  

you’re all you will ever be  
and to me, you need no notes  

the fact that every trip to the west  
will always include you  
for some summit on a bare mountain  
some cocktail with a view  

I’ve loved you for so long  
I’ve so many memories with you  
across so many places   
and somehow still so separate  

and I love how the way I feel  
is so subdued, so subtle  
you’ve never required a show  
I can just be me   
and you can just be you  
and no one will ever understand us  
the way we do
