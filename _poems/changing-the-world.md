I finally watched that documentary.    
her old postdoc advisor—a guy I now know well—   
said in the interview clip,   
“this woman’s gonna change the world someday,   
just you wait.”    
and I suppose she did—the media climate    
is forever changed   
while the climate stays the same.   
the last postdoc and I get together sometimes,    
like two members of a grief council,   
to speak of the ways she’s changed our worlds.    
we’ve both been pushed to physical illness    
because we were the only ones who could resist    
when she asked us to lie.
