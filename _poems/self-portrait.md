bloodshot eyes against ice  
blue as oceans above indents  
showing lack of sleep, or maybe  
just so much carried over years  

years of holding what is too heavy  
for the next twenty something stepping in  
but so much more you can handle, apparently  
and if you act none the wiser, oh, what a sin  

for we expect that the lacking frontal cortices  
from the men who surround you, your brothers  
cousins, roommates, classmates, coworkers  
they need time to compensate lack of wisdom  

but don’t you dare have a lapse in charisma  
the moment you showcase as empty a brain  
as they around you demonstrate  
you know then you’ve failed on all planes  

you must be better than a man  
you must never stoop so low as him  
he is allowed to express the most bare of stupidity  
but I swear to God, if you let me witness such offense
