he once said to me, “I can’t ever interact  
with anyone who engages  
in the act of anti-intellectualism”   
and expected me to drop whatever I had on    
right then and there for him.   

here’s my deal—    
why would I ever want to create something    
that couldn’t be enjoyed by my grandmother,    
rising like the sun over Iowa cornfields,    
on her farm with no running water,    
in a town with less than thirty,   
with no ability to tell right from left?    

we’ve always gotta tell her, “your way—my way”    
to give her directions on the drive.    
she’s dyslexic so says her words wrong half the time,    
like asking whether I found the licorice-y kick of fentanyl    
in the soup she made for those she adores.    

but here’s what I’ll tell him—    
my grandma always knows which way’s north;    
she’s more accurate than your fifty-dollar compass,    
and she’ll always, always perform a perfect parallel park.    

she can’t ever get the names right the first time    
of any of those medications at work,    
but the doctors request her on each and every case    
with a patient most in need of comfort,   
because of how she is with those at their worst.    

so yeah;   
take that intellectualism    
and shove it wherever works.
