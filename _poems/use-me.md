oh my dear friend elegiac  
use me for anything you'd like  
use me and I will use back  
and I trust you will use me right  

use me to show your luck with women  
use me as a way to meet other friends  
use me for a night or fun experience  
use me for all your means and ends  

use me to know what you'd not before  
use me when a joke is worth a laugh  
use me for a task you wish to ignore  
use me for a meal you'd cut in half  

use me for a way to split your rent  
use me for relief to end your day  
use me when energy's all been spent  
use me to wipe your tears away  

use me for all parts of my body  
use me to be close or far as you need  
use me for the times your memory's spotty  
use me to know you've lost the lead  

oh, but please don't use my love  
will you just take it from another?   
for it's my father who used up  
all the light inside my mother
