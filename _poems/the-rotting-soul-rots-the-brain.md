you’re nothing but a hull  
of wasted potential  
and I know you will somehow  
find in that a thing to be proud  

some are too stupid  
to read between the lines  
you care about your intellectual dignity  
more than the prospect of being a good person  

at least in your total void  
you can pretend the echoes are applause
