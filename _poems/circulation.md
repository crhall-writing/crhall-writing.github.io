*you blunder here—you’re part of the mountain*  
if you don’t keep it up, you’ll surely die.  

after that crash in the Andes,  
survivors punched each other’s arms  
to maintain circulation  
when their clothes were frozen.  

there’s no running water in parts of Yakutia;  
you get not a single day off  
where infrastructure won’t come to save you—  
it’s a question of frostbite, not discomfort.  

*oh—fuck.*  
a plume of powder consumes the windshield.  
a Chevy is idle, hazards on.  
I turn the heat up and wait on a tow truck.
