*you blunder here—you’re part of the mountain*  
if you don’t keep it up, you’ll surely die  
 
in that plane crash in the Andes  
survivors punched each other’s arms  
to maintain circulation  
when their clothes were frozen  

there’s no running water in parts of Yakutia   
you get not a single day off   
where infrastructure won’t come to save you  
it’s a question of frostbite, not discomfort   

*oh—fuck.*   
a plume of powder slams into the windshield  
a truck is idle, hazards on  
I turn the heat up, now to wait on a tow truck
