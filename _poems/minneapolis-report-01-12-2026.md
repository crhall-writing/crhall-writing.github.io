I suppose it started off twenty five hours ago  
but felt like a lifetimes’s gone by  
fighting fascism on the west side  

first I’m at the hilton canpopy  
blowing a whistle til I’d feel my lungs’ll give out  
banging an umbrella handle on a pole until   
it breaks straight in two  

then the fuzz comes like it always does  
and in all honesty the response, it seemed  
moral and just, these kids explaining to the twelve  
“they’re killing us”, and they know all too well  
they tell the crowd, “you guys are winning—  
we can see an end to this terror, push just enough  
to get us here to give you the eyes and media  
and we’ll come back, again and again  
we don’t want those Nazi’s either”  

and then some guy walks through, hands me a five dollar bill  
tells us we are doing what no one else will  
it’s these kids, more eloquent than the professors I speak with  
they’ve got their dreams buried in a brighter future  
unlike these phd students who will never go anywhere  
different  

then I’m sleeping for five or six hours  
get up, coffee cup, half’s enough  
it’s too hot, like the tips in the dispatch  
and I get out, patrol every neighborhood  
I’ve thought to be vulnerable  
“plate check,” and I can’t remember the first three  
and “negative” rings back, and it becomes some game  

when I see them, of course I can help  
what a wonderful thing it is to help  
but if I see them, of course I’ll get pepper-bombed  
need to roll my windows up, get to the next car wash  
make sure ventilation is inside, never outward bound  
they’ll break my windows, pull me out  
put me in cuffs, until some noble bystander makes a record  
‘cause they hate their faces engraved into history  

nine hours later I’m on plate check, then they don’t have capacity  
and dispatch is me, suddenly, I fall into the role  
the way I’ve always done; telling each person how to remain safe  
in a fucking nazi gestapo state, and I have real people here  
doing real work that helps real people  
and pushing the button  
is suddenly  
what makes it all  
worth it
