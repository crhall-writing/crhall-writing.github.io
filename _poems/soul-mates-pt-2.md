it’s packed in here   
filled with all-aged clientele  
I’ve got your arm linked in mine  

through the stench of tobacco  
I can smell your new cologne, your dark beard  
contrasts to my bare, blushed cheeks, next track  

bass bumping, you tell me our karaoke song  
is coming up in five; army of lovers’ “crucified”   
and something, dampened now, fears a future  
 
but for now, I know the only potential fight  
I’ll have with you is over who gets an eligible bachelor  
you’re my soulmate in a world where souls don’t exist
