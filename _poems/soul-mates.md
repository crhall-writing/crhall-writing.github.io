I’m such a sucker  
for a laugh with you  
you who looks at me  
like I owe you nothing  
somehow whenever  
you come around me  
there’s someone else  
trying to take something  
why is it I feel so safe  
with you who’s never  
asked anything of me?  

I can’t wait to see you  
to be in a dress  
and you in some suit  
and scream our heads off  
have dances without meaning  
closeness without anything  
lurking underneath. you are  
my soulmate in a world  
where souls don’t exist  
and I’m so happy to have  
met you
