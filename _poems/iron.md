I’ve too much iron in my body  
I go to the blood bank and they check my hemoglobin   
my hemoglobin’s all good, they say   
but hemochromatosis lives in my liver, my pancreas, my heart   
and they tell me the reason your heart’s not magnetic     
is because the iron’s not in a form to clump up in pumped blood   
but I think my heart flies out my chest to the nearest piece of lead   
metallic poison   
and they say milk thistle might help my chances  
she’s there, thick blonde hair falling down to her waistline  
whether in a ponytail or down, sublime   
closely related to a daisy    
and she’s got no metallic poison in her veins    
catapulting her to some catastrophe   
that acts like a new father who should’ve never had offspring   
and she asks me about my day   
acting like it’s a story she can’t put down  
even when there’s nothing notable to say
