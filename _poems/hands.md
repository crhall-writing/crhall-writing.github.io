10:54am  
his mouth hung down, left  
exposing his bottom teeth, patterned with black,  
brown, and green  
“they’re turning blue”  
she said, between small gaps of planned-out grief  
watching his lips, never again to speak  
the way we three would always do  

I suppose I didn’t know how pale he’d been  
but I’d never seen hands more light  
and soft, so small and frail  
wilted to drift like daffodils in the breeze  
“they look so peaceful,”  
I said, holding her just as tight  
to split her right in two  

“he was so proud of you,”   
and I nod like I know something we all could see    
but I wish I could tell him how sorry  
so, so sorry I was  
for each time I wished this day would come
