talking to you feels like  
you can look at something  
and truly choose to become  
deaf or blind  

it’s like staring at a photograph  
missing pieces  
either from tearing   
or from burning  

you are so unable to see  
anything as a whole  
it’s embarrassing to see  
the lengths you’ll go to avoid  

anything you don’t want to know  
I don’t think I ever could  
ask for explanation  
and stare so ignorantly, blankly  

I try not to judge, or feel above  
I hate egos already enough  
but God, there must be a hole  
in that small brain you own
