how does it feel to be on the sidelines,  
not in the mud and the dirt,  
scared to get your fingernails dirty?  
scared to sift through the dirt of understanding?  

since 1999, 70% of violence  
we experience is by white men,  
and a large part of that  
is by men of a young age.  

you’re scared to enter the melting pot  
and face what makes you uncomfortable.  
you’re scared of abandoning cynicism  
because it may make you vulnerable for once;  

and being vulnerable is a scary thing--  
one most are forced into experiencing;  
but you’ll never have to do this  
in a tall and grey stony tower.  

but you’ll soon find out:   
your lack of sincerity,  
holding onto egos so grand,  
can and will take its toll on you.  

that toll will lead to some questions--  
of what makes this life worth it.  
do you not understand?   
if you want to stay safe, express yourself.  

become a *“yes-man”*  
with the confidence  
to try something new,  
to try to understand things foreign to you.  

you know, I was born in 1999,  
and the game hasn’t changed to this day.  
you guys are still here, scared--  
of entering the vulnerable, the unknown.  

and what a shame you stay the same.  
you claim to have all the knowledge, the whole shebang;  
but you prefer to quiver and remain  
in a dark-lit bedroom, and to derogate.  

how does it feel  
to waste your humanity?
