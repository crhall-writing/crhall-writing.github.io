pupils dilate; leftover coffee  
the one you should’ve thrown away  
grinds into your veins   
and the bass thumps so loud  
you roll down the windows   
to invite the night to rock along  

asphalt stretches and thins  
and runs wherever you let it  
you can follow it forward  
or break off into the field  

witness the coliseum of speckles  
over the realm of no witnesses  
surrounded by black mounds  
rising to a faint outline  

gated reverb drops  
again, again  
your head swings with it  
not a single beautiful man or woman  
can save you like this  

it’s just you and the space between  
humid air, cottonwood  
even the itches and snot it brings  
and three thousand miles to go  
each another reason to keep going
