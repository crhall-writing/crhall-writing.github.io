oh, these New Masters  
enough credit never bestowed  
oh, if one day I might understand  
one day the words and notes flow  
but I don’t think that’s my path  
and how I wish it were  
to be in some dark basement  
words that will be admired  
and simply respected and enjoyed  
that the first instinct will be to listen  
regardless of my clothes  
regardless of my hair  
regardless of what’s between my legs  
but there will always be those   
forcing you to open them  
as they say again and again  
and yes, oh how true that is  
but does that not also happen   
as I attempt to write with chalk
as I attempt to build my tools
as I attempt to solve things unknown
they will always be there
seeing me for what they will
I might as well go with my temper
and they can watch me do what I will
with hand gripping their member
