I remember—was it a year ago already?  
I was in this very room  
beneath these very covers  
wondering how I’d ever go on  
knowing it wouldn’t be me  

in a van, somewhere in a far-off desert  
making those memories on polaroids  
we’d one day look upon  
maybe after thirty years  

maybe we’d meet again  
and think of the intensity of our journey  
maybe we’d have been close all that time  
but neither means anything  

without those moments we never got  
the shots never taken  
no memories I could’ve eventually forgot  
I never had the option  

and sometimes you still come to me in a dream  
like it was still that window of time we both were free  
before so much reality got in between  
and you don’t need to say, instead just be  

real for once, not a figment of my malleable mind  
the one I’m sure you loved to contort  
like the ballerina only you seemed to notice I once was  
and I wonder how aware you were of all those seeds  

had you planted them on purpose?  
making me feel special just long enough  
to get whatever it was you wanted?  
and I’m sure you got it after so many months  

as one day, I remember it in detail  
you looked at me like a broom looks to dust  
and so shortly before we’d stay up  
like it was always coincidence every instance  

and each night when we found it was just the two of us  
you reminded me of something no one else knew  
that I had forgotten about myself  
but there wasn’t anything more I could do  

and I think now, about the bed of soil  
I don’t think anything was set to grow  
maybe the field was salted  
and there’s nothing to reap where nothing was sowed   

but now—so long later  
the coldness of your stare no longer scares  
and it doesn’t make me question any intention  
it’s just there  

hidden in some sacred place towards the back of my diaphragm  
and I’d like to suppose you’ll always be right there  
but life can go on and be full and alive  
without any pictures to prove I was right  

who cares if you ever cared?  
I’m glad I knew you  
but the world is beautiful, every peak and trough    
to see it myself, for time is precious enough
