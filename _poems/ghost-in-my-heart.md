I don’t have time to ponder on  
the ghost that lives in my heart  
I don’t have time to linger  
on that reflection for enough time  
to make it warp into a figure  
resembling who I wish was there most  

I wish I had more time  
to pretend I’ll ever see you again    
I wish the world wouldn’t fall apart  
if I took some time  
to hear some voices that might be you  

but the world won’t stop turning  
no matter how much I ask it to
