It's still easy to feel something grip me and lose myself in a perfect regurgitation of my innermost guts and intestines. I surprise myself when I look back on the paper—the writing, the drawing, the music. I don’t know what it is possessing me, but sometimes I believe it’s the universe, or maybe some kind of god. Anyone or anything who will take the burden off my shoulders and make my consciousness into something that will bring me joy, novelty in my mundane day-to-day. I want someone else to do this all for me, often, and there is some type of divinity that separates me from myself, and puts everything into words for me, as if I’m witnessing a spirit that has a story it wants to make known--some deep and beautiful truth that needs to come to the surface, and I am merely a vessel through which it creates such divine and wonderful prose.   

There are very few things on this earth that are second-nature to me, and I am so thankful writing appears to be one of them. What a wonderful life it is to have a consciousness that blurts every tiny fragment of emotion, of understanding, of potential situations, and my fingers exist simply to record. I felt so unbelievably close to the universe, to a force separated from me, yet which lives inside of me. Where does it live? I would say in my chest, maybe right behind my eyes, maybe in my throat. The feeling I get when I cry that type of gasping, uncontrollable, hideous cry, when my eyes become puffed as if I took a long drop in to the neighborhood wasp hive—the tightness of the throat, the heaviness of the eyes I believe is the spirit trying to escape, that anytime I can barely exist on my own, yet have no desire for togetherness, is when the spirit wishes to take over and create something bigger than myself or what my mortal flesh seems to feel.   

He must feel this same way. Retired to the stale sterility of suction machines, tube-feeding bags, medication organizers.
