surrounded by gourds  
filled with warmth  
but there’s something 
about warmth  
it has to come from  
a correct place  
a place that makes sense  
and everything breaks  
in a simple drop of a brush  
it’ll roll to the other side  
of the floor  
had I not put those sheets  
covering the wood and rugs  
the dim lighting above  
all of a sudden is piercing  
the way words can do so  
and I’d know, especially now  
and I’m singled out  
in ways I never anticipated  
why did none of it make sense  
and the moment it does  
sends me back to age ten  
wondering what I’ve done  
how it should’ve gone  
my eyes were always so wide  
do they become fatigued  
from the way I’ve held  
them open for so much time?  
I’ll sit here and take it  
and I’ll wonder what it was  
that made me deserve it  
but eventually I’ll funnel that  
the big feelings of long ago  
will just become anger  
a new crust layered around  
and each time that happens  
I become everything  
and anything  
I fear I’d become
