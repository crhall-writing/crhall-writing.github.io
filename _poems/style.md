I used to be so set on  
obsessed with the thought of   
having a set style  
but looking back  
at the pieces I hated   
because the painting didn’t look like Hopper  
or the photo wasn’t staged like Bailey  
or the writing never flowed like Chesterton  
one day it all came together  
something new cannot look like any other  
the fact that they all came from an artist  
honestly doing their best to be honest  
you can’t mistake where they originate  
and maybe the real hardship  
was assigning ambiguous punishment  
when the goal itself was fallacious
