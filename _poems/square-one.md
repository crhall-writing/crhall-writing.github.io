somehow I’ve been transported   
back over to square one  
I’ve got a pounding headache  
and nostrils burning  

it’s like I’m back in California  
but for some inexplicable reason  
California’s now a tundra  
one that makes me feel small  

all the same, I’m back there  
square one is a happy place  
and I realize all those big experiences  
the ones I hold onto so nearly  

and so dearly, were all for naught  
for I’m still just looking up, waiting  
maybe wanting something different  
than I ever did before  

but I want to feel all the same  
I know things exist now that I never did  
there’s a new depth to the world   
that I never could've imagined  

but I am the same person as before  
I like all the same little things, y’know  
I am easily pleased and easily upset  
and I love to be alone and day dream  

dream of love that I’ll never really want  
savor being alone while missing others  
hoping to one day leave to another place  
a place where everything is brand new  

things here are getting stale for me  
I can feel it in my bones, in my liver  
life itself has grown mould and spores  
that will spread and intoxicate and splinter    

so I know I’ve gotta get out and start anew  
we all do, don’t we not?  
I’ll go and practice all those languages  
I’m so enthusiastic about  

and even though I know so many  
will be angry at my decisions  
I can’t help but smile, smile at the courage  
I think is built inside of me
