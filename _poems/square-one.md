somehow I’ve been transported   
back over to square one  
I’ve got a pounding headache  
and nostrils burning  

it’s like I’m back in California  
but for some inexplicable reason  
California’s now a tundra  
one that makes me feel small  

all the same, I’m back there  
square one is a happy place  
and I realize all those big experiences  
the ones I hold onto so nearly  

and so dearly, were all for naught  
for I’m still just looking up, waiting  
maybe wanting something different  
than I ever did before  

but I want to feel all the same  
I know things exist now that I never did  
there’s a new depth to the world   
that I never could've imagined  

but I'm the same person as before  
I like the same little things, y’know  
I'm easily pleased and easily upset  
and I love to be alone and daydream  

dream of love that I don't really want  
savor alone time while missing others  
hoping to one day leave to another place  
a place where everything's sleek and new  

things are getting stale for me  
I can feel it in my bones, in my liver  
life itself has grown mould and spores  
that will spread, toxify, and splinter  

so I've gotta get out and start anew  
we all do, don’t we not?  
I’ll go and practice all those languages  
I’m so enthusiastic about  

and even though I know so many  
will be angry at my decisions  
I can’t help but smile--smile at the courage  
that must've been here since square one
