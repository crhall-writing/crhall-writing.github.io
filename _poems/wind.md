“lighter's out.”  
“what do you mean it’s out?”  
“the butane's not warm enough.”  
I look up at the small flecks against the night sky;  
one falls into my tear duct—small jerk of my head—  
now to leave a frosted streak down to my chin.  
the last match didn’t succeed in starting civilization;  
all's left to do is shrug and escape the gales.   
and the thwacks and flaps of tent fabric   
deny a dreamless sleep.    
I breathe in, my nostrils informing me  
what we couldn't will has been done by wind.
