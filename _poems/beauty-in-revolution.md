we think of revolution as a bunch of kids in a dark room  
lit by nothing aside from the dim flicker of a crashing bulb   
one we can’t afford to replace, and each face   
some hollywood recreation of what we think righteousness is   
if they act beautifully they must look beautiful, and vice versa 

nah, my sisters and brothers I adore inside and out   
they’re men who look like women and women who look like men   
and everywhere in between they’re searching for   
the solution that’s gonna compound the accountability   
to those who’ve been abusing this system for far too long   

they’re the ones you need, not the beautiful girls  
or society-accepted guys who ran their frats in college  
the revolution is ugly, and rightly so  
we deem pretty the faces that have held their power spilling blood
