ambiguous is the loss  
of a life you never knew  
the loss of serotonin  
and the loss of tomorrow  

and that loss comes far before  
the physical that shifts no more  
you’ll never save anyone  
and they can’t save themselves  

hell, you can’t even save yourself  
who are you to toe the line?  
you’ll only bring disappointment  
by pretending there’s more to you  

you see the hope in their eyes  
that you’ll provide some wisdom  
something magical they’ve never known  
and then the way their faces fall  

the way you think on it the rest of the day   
and for the weeks you’re lacking chemistry  
the rest of the week or of the month  
and then you know it’ll never change  

and you’ll be drowned by witnesses  
trying to give every bit of yourself  
and you know it’ll never be enough  
and you wish you were more than this  

enough for someone to step in  
enough for someone to say “that’s enough”  
but the less you have to give  
the more they seem to want it
