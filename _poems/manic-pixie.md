the problem with the manic pixie dream girl  
we think she doesn’t exist, oh but she does  
you see her there, dance with her and twirl  
you leave with the ceasing music because  

…well, you don’t like to think about it, really  
for some reason she’s just not like before  
the point’s to show your flawed ways, silly  
but, ugh, the learning part’s such a bore  

that’s the whole goal, do you not see?   
if you don’t change, who will you be?  
you think no girl will ever be your manic pixie  
‘cause you lack the desire to be rebriefed?    

and it’s not her fault—you know it never was  
it’s not up to her to change you, novitiate  
you won’t change for her—a grand faux pas  
your true and lazy selves won’t conciliate
