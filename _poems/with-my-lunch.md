if I hear one more gorgeous woman  
quietly, slyly, shyly, mildly, kindly, not-too-highly,   
give some aside about her unpopularity growing up,  
twirling a lock of long, glistening hair that swirls past her whatever-cups,   
I’d take it with my lunch.  

I’m leaving that job to the men;  
I know she’ll get enough from her friends and boyfriend   
and none of them would care if she looked like Sydney Heaven  
or my grandma after a heart attack at seventy-seven.  

she’s going to suck it up, like a good girl does,  
and wonder not when it’ll stop,  
moving her strands out the way to showcase a smile—  
but not too wide—    
don’t ever enjoy it too much.
