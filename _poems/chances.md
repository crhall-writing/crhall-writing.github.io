god, you know, that day

I crashed my car going five

all because the way

your foot pressed to mine



each chance to shake you

you'd take one more

when clothes soaked through

your pat in my core



those sad eyes stare

in mine like I know

a half-lidded dare

and my soul to go



and you stopped me there

you saw each wrong

soon tell me, you'd swear

you knew all along



it slipped through, though

too late down the hall

none now to know

knowing's blown, after all
