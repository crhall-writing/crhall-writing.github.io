I held a glass of wine, leaning back against the dining room table. I stood and watched him write, drawing pictures that amazed me, diagrams that could’ve only come from a place of pure brilliance, with perfect understanding of all he sees. 

<br>

I’ve always had a thing for people with memories---people who remember what I tell them and bring it up as if it were nothing. 

<br>

For the first time I didn’t feel like a mentor, or a mother, or a friend. I felt like this little girl, staring at something so amazing I couldn’t look away. I stared at you so often and felt so much deep within me. I felt oceans moving within me; I felt the weight of every experience I’ve ever experienced. I felt the wind whipping through my hair and it was the freshest air I’d ever breathed when standing even close to you. I knew I had to go, but God, I was scared to never feel that feeling again.
