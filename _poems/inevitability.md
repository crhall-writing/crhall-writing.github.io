I’ve grown to understand that, given enough time,   
it’ll inevitably happen.   
I don’t know the exact reason or rhyme,   
but eventually there comes a day when   

I’m no longer curious about what you’re up to,     
I’m no longer hoping the notification’s from you,     
I’m no longer wishing for the day you’ll come through   
my door saying you’ve grandly messed up and stew   

about what could’ve been. that’s a then problem,   
and the world is filled with situations of now.   
now, suddenly the world doesn’t revolve   
around you, and it seems tiring to even consider how   

I’d ever incorporate you into my life again.   
I’m not so different, I don’t suppose I am,  
but I no longer can put the effort in  
to making space for you to understand.  

and what’s really so noticeable  
is the fact that I didn’t notice it happening at all.
