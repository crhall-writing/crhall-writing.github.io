from Steinbeck: I guess a loving woman is indestructible.   
and I know, preemptively, as you read, you think and feel  
something about how women are mistreated, dispelled   
why did it take the words of a man, to get you to that afflatus  

how many women will equal one Steinbeck? one Wilde?   
and I love Wilde, don’t be in disarray, I love him without  
any inhibition. and Fitzgerald and Stevenson and Chesterton  
are alright, yes, but why, like Jekyll and Hyde, do you find  

truth only in the universe to which you subscribe?
