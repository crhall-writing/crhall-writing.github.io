with every draw,  
the light bounces against ripples.  
sitting beside me, watching all the same—  

“here’s where we differ,” he leans into my shoulder,  
“those boats don’t deserve to disrupt traffic.  
these cars are forced to wait—how many times tonight?”  

I nod without a word, and a few minutes later,  
the two haves, once more, become one.  
they say they do this more at night   
to accommodate the daytime drives.
