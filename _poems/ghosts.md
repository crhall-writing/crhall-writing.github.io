the ghosts of Woods Hole Oceanographic  
of NIST and NOAA and NREL  
they’ll haunt me, forever maybe.  
the fact that I can’t admire  
the twilight as I saw it, wrapped  
in nothing but a sleeping bag  
on the mat against the snow  
never becoming black, clouds  
reflected thousands of shades  
between blue and red; and  
so much white—more than   
I’ve ever seen. a canvas   
so blank, quiet, to absorb  
every color, every sound,   
every dream once dreamt.   
one day, when I’m no longer  
some imposter, maybe then  
I’ll feel something more than dread
