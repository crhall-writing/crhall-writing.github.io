beautiful boy  
the one I thought I wanted to have  
but maybe just wanted to be  
at only thirteen  
being too scared to sing eyeliner  
fifteen years ago  
fearing the cruelty of the world awaiting  
and how have things changed  
your voice now deep as a man’s  
the same world that embraced you  
maybe forgot you all the same  
but you never have to be afraid again
