you’d look at the scars on her stomach   
like engravings on a golden palm   
any slight hints to a specter in the attic   
helping you jack it, what a bomb-   

shell, yeah, I liked her pink hair   
and her voice wasn’t one of a kind   
but it was fine enough to care   
enough about whether she will cry   

enough just to keep me intrigued   
but not enough to inconvenience me   
or embarrass me around my buddies   
we like ‘em broken, and you see,   

it’s not ‘cause I care about the reason;   
she better never become a burden on us   
I want her happy through my own sad season   
but she better not enjoy it too much   

that’s my job, and her’s is to stay selfless   
waiting on me to get over my sadness   
I want her frail and dumb and helpless  
so I don’t have to work too hard for dominance
