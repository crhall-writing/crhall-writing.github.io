sometimes I wonder  
and discuss aloud to others  
or with my own self, internal  
what does it mean   
for someone to really be  
a human being?   

as long as someone exists  
so long as they think  
they are, apparently  
but in what world  
does someone hear   
some of the greatest horrors  
and think  
how can I make this  
all serve me?  

to hear of people starving  
voluntarily or involuntarily  
of people choking   
at the very moment of lying down  
do you not know   
what life you would lead  
if you went a year without  
lying down without death  
being a side effect?   
to know those around  
did and spoke the unspeakable  
though never doing and never speaking  
once lifting a finger is too inconvenient   

it’s a lucky world  
for those who can choose  
when and when not they want to watch  

people are dying  
minds are collapsing  
and there’s so much we can do to make it stop  

“that’s no matter.  
do you know how long its been  
since a woman’s finished me off?”
