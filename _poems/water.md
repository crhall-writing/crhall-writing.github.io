water--most difficult to draw  
even harder to animate  
liquid, solid, or gaseous  
always shifting, always  
seeping through the gates  

sometimes it glows  
sometimes it subdues  
sometimes it layers and cloaks  
sometimes it looms  
sometimes it rushes, crashes, overwhelms  
enters you without permission  
suffocates you  
reminds you what you are  

you can seek to strike it, sure  
you'll glide straight through  
you must stop trying, bourgeois  
to drink up the ocean through a straw  

go to the drawing table  
sit across from these lot  
Petrov, Pal, Podpomogov  
what would they say to you?  
they know how to combine  
everything you've ever tried  
they paint songs  
sing textures  
they'd tell you to absorb  
the essence of all  

now glass under streaks  
oil-sheened, soft dreams  
even when he's pulled beneath  
and the siren he sees  
he gasps more than he breathes  
in blending swirl of storm and gleam  
whisked ashore on sand-brushed beach  
to lie ever painted in eternal sleep  

but savior of Holland and all  
nuts and bolts marching tall  
and to the dark night he called  
but she was taken by the screwballs  
and he prayed to crumbling walls  
drops of gems now glisten and fall  
and the figures rust to stonewall  
she returns in technicolored shawl  
whittled tulips shall always sprawl  

then translucent veil contrasts  
the veil, the veil, oh, at long last  
a never-before-viewed style masterclass  
and the soft glow of light, shadows downcast  
take all the attention from the film artifacts    
and from the castle that night she passed  
down steps, now with feet of burnished brass  
her tears showed a world of frosted glass  
they distorted and swayed every landmass   
and she became planted, herself a clast  
beneath the lake of despair she amassed
