water--most difficult to draw  
even harder to animate  
liquid, solid, evaporates  
always shifting, always  
seeping through the gates  

sometimes it glows  
sometimes it subdues  
sometimes it layers and cloaks  
sometimes it looms  
sometimes it rushes, crashes, overwhelms  
enters you without permission  
suffocates you  
reminds you what you are  

you can seek to strike it, sure  
you'll glide straight through  
stop trying, bourgeois  
to drink the ocean through a straw  

go to the drawing table  
sit across these lot  
Petrov, Pal, Podpomogov  
what would they opine?  
they combine  
all forms you've tried  
they paint songs  
sing textures  
they'd tell you to absorb  
the essence of worlds  

now glass under streaks  
oil-sheened, soft dreams  
even when he's pulled beneath  
by the siren he sees  
he gasps more than breathes  
in a blended swirl of storm and gleam  
whisked to shore on sand-brushed beach  
to bathe in glossy sun and ceaseless sleep  

but savior of Holland and all  
nuts and bolts marching tall  
to the dark night he called  
but she was taken by screwballs  
and he prayed to crumbling walls  
drops of gems now glisten, fall  
and the figures rust to stonewall  
she returns in technicolored shawl  
whittled tulips shall always sprawl  

then translucent veil contrasts  
the veil, the veil, oh, at long last  
a never-before-viewed style masterclass  
and the soft glowing light, shadows cast  
eminate through the film's artifacts    
and from the castle that night she passed  
down steps, feet turned to burnished brass  
her tears showed a world of frosted glass  
they distorted and swayed every landmass   
and she became planted, herself a clast  
beneath the lake of despair she amassed
