how strange is the feeling  
to have given up  
on falling in love  
or on finding it appealing  

I thought that, yes, becoming whole  
would mark the right time  
it's no longer mine  
I'm now happier alone  

I fear everyone around  
will look with pity  
"she was so pretty  
under her tears she'll be drowned"  

but away I wept those tears  
I am now become  
like an emptied drum  
how could I go on for fifty years  

I recall, waterey-eyed 
I said I'm empty  
I am so empty  
"but I want more", he cried  

but at least you're not alone  
how do they not know  
all the things you will owe  
just for the sake of being owned  

and being empty feels free  
nothing you can use  
nothing I can lose  
and nothing will return to me  

how could I possibly have beared  
to never see grass  
turn frozen at last  
nor be burned by the freezing air  

I now breathe at 10,000 feet  
though the air is thin  
when I take it in  
nothing has ever smelled so sweet  

was it a way to be filled?  
have someone inside  
it'll stop your mind  
who cares if the self is killed  

I remember you would talk  
when I was thinking  
and my heart sinking   
you didn't need to hear my thoughts  

now not a thought incomplete  
I'm living in sin  
my hair whipped in wind  
I'm high up at 10,000 feet  

I love the cold wind, you see  
how you accept it  
how you respect it  
else it brings you to your knees  

I loved how I'd make you laugh  
though now how I try  
to recall your eyes  
I miss splitting meals in half  

had I been anything more  
than a distraction  
excuse for action  
or for filling some vacant drawer  

you could've filled it with clothes  
tee shirts of players  
names and name-sayers   
or socks with five little toes  

no amount of love-making  
could ever make love  
worthy to give up  
everything that you were taking  

love is not biology  
though my body begs  
for someone's DNA   
to be shoved deep inside of me  

"happy mom you'll never make"  
her words were vivid   
and I was livid  
but she was right for rightness' sake  

"you'd raise my children so well"  
his words were fluid   
what if I do it  
how special it made me feel  

please sacrifice your art for me  
you are not that good  
at painting on wood  
it's just one more drop in the sea  

please surrender your light for me  
you're no Fred Astaire  
you've children to bear  
it's just one more drop in the sea  

what will this ever bring to me?  
her breasts too saggy  
stomach too flabby  
this isn't the girl you married  

what will this ever bring to me?  
she's not like before  
not fit anymore  
this isn't the girl you married  

what will this ever bring to me?   
two hours of sleep  
that's all that she needs  
this isn't the girl you married  

what will this ever bring to me?  
she's now so angry  
don't shake the baby  
this isn't the girl you married  

what will this ever bring to me?   
children eyes blue  
freckles you can view  
why else would you want to marry?   

what if it's born without eyes  
with skin falling off?  
is it still enough  
to give up the rest of your life?   

I'm one of a kind, you'd say  
but soon you forget  
the moment you've met  
a girl with better DNA  

you thought you had optimized  
a brain so complex  
performance in sex  
and yet no need to ask why  

have we not both seen plenty  
to see it repeat  
fate's waiting to meet  
what comes out at age twenty  

stumbling upon again  
body limp and grey  
hell've a drug, they'll say  
routine for a La Quinta Inn  

what if I, rather, come upon  
a child so perfect  
it's me they reject  
how would I ever go on?  

does the idea still make blood  
rush down to your thighs  
where you're circumcised  
and pool 'til you've let out the flood?  

what if it fails to relieve?  
the moments before  
they often mean more  
than after you've spread all your seed
