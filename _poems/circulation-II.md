I’ve got two lungs still  
even though they’re collapsing in on themselves;  
maybe the concavity of mine  
will undo the convexity of yours.  

I’ve got a method for getting it out—   
the air that seems to come and go—   
get into the car, drive to the bridge  
above the town of a hundred Christmases. 

as you pass by the boat docks, say hello  
let the hairs on your neck stand and trill;  
the body beyond blackness, like an old friend.  

past the refinery, refining poison all the same  
and you’ll smell the evidence of a sinning city.  

and if you drive too far, you’ll hit the wood,  
the one that hugs you until you’re warm like old  
times—times never accompanying a picture.  

you can pitch a tent anywhere you’d like,  
I’ll always remember those freezing nights    
on the way to see you, like I always do.     

and you see him standing at the edge   
of the balcony, soaked in memory    
he was there through the highs and lows  
and now there’s a lump in your throat,   

mirroring the lump in his chest—  
though he always seemed to know best,     
he’ll never know where you’ve really been.  

the clouds once blocked the kaleidoscope,  
and one day, they receded.   
he’s gone, to nowhere above;   
he was never one for religion.
