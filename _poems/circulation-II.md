I’ve got two lungs still      
even though they’re collapsing in on themselves;    
maybe the concavity of mine      
will undo the convexity of yours.        

I’ve got a method for getting it out—     
the air that seems to come and go—        
get in the car, drive to the bridge    
above the town of a hundred Christmases.     

as you pass by the boat docks, say hello    
let the hairs on your neck stand and trill—    
to the body beyond blackness, like an old friend.    

past the refinery, refining poison all the same,    
you’ll smell the evidence of a sinning city.     

and drive too far, you’ll hit the wood,    
the one that hugs you warm like old    
times—never exhuming a picture.     
you can pitch a tent anywhere;  
I’d freeze the night through  
each time just to see you.   

and if you see him standing at the edge   
of the balcony, soaked in memory,  
recall he was there through the highs and lows  
and now there’s a lump in your throat,  

mirroring the lump in his chest—     
though he always seemed to know best,     
he’ll never know where you’ve really been.  

the clouds once blocked the kaleidoscope,  
and one day, they receded.  
he’s gone, to nowhere above;  
he was never one for religion.
