you feel entitled to what you hate  
what a strange process  
she's gorgeous, with the types of eyes  
that stick on you into the next year  

but you're reminded  
of someone so ugly beneath the skin  
it makes your tongue heat like you might gag  
anyone who looks like her repulses nowadays  

take it away  
I'd rather never see again  
than to see something  
with such a stench trailing
