I used to make puppets out of thick, paperback books
my favorite pillow, a red cylindrical bean-filled sausage
the book would bite down, like a dog on a marshmallow
and I'd feel this incredible level of delight. so much so
that eventually, I started finding ways to play with others
the hard covers, maroon and blue, so sleek and shining
pages glossed and pure white, text dark like a stark night
I never knew a single meaning behind the contrasted ink
and how I'd think, I'd never in my life understand anything
wondering what were these snakes, the stretched, long "s"
I remember my greatest fear was that line with two dots
my brother would turn red in his face in frustration with it
and I knew then, if he could not get it, then I never would
if I could go back and sit her down, on my knee, with a frown
tell her, yes, you would soon understand everything feared
but you wouldn't be proud; you'd not be any closer to God
you'd still be right back where you started; and you forgot
through all the medals and travels and praise and whatnot
happiness it never brought; even atop all those thoughts
you wished it would've been so easy; you know now it's not
there are so many other parts; you'll never get the whole lot
