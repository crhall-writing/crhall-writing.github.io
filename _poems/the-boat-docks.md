vasovagal syncope  
fascinates me  
so much that I make regular drops  
to the often warned-of boat docks.  

the ones where I pray my car never breaks  
or that I never slide down basin to lake;  
keep me between life and death,  
my heart lowered with my breath.  

I can’t remember life without them looming,  
or the way my nerves are all-consuming,  
when face-to-face with a covered colossus  
emerging from the black bath beneath the frost.  

and I come back–alone each time  
to taste what it is to be alive.  
I won’t leave this yard for good;  
that scares me more than docks ever could.
