some days I become overwhelmed with grief, brought by longing for the scenes I’ll never see; the sea once starved of oxygen, once inhabited by those which would eventually become poisoned by its infiltration; the small ripples in water—a water so devoid of familiarity it seems almost dishonest to refer to it as such—formed by the tiny wiggles of creatures that saw themselves as normally-sized, at a time in which predation was scarce and they could live in relative harmony--when living was to exist instead of to battle and rise above.
