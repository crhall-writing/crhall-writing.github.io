Why is she so angry  
Where has her beauty gone  
Why is she no longer intrigued  
Now so wicked and so wrong   

Others do it for me  
And do it with such grace  
So what is it about she  
Oh why must she be so full of hate  

I am poor for I am lonely
I am sad with no need for therapy
For my mother would do it for me
So what is missing in she

Oh she who is so cruel, now ugly
Much uglier than before is she
For once she had face of beauty
Where is her sun-like personality 

She is now as any man
Any man that I despise
She does not see me for who I am
If only she’d open her eyes

Why does she no longer listen
For I have been through so much more
She must hear my experience
Her life has been too easy I’m sure

Oh but I, on the other hand
Have seen horrors and terrors unmatched
Ships through storms I have manned
And by so many monsters been attacked

I have finally figured out life
I have been pushed far enough to learn
I am knowing and I am right
For my suffering has all been earned

But never mind that all
I know her anger has no reason
My anger from standing so tall
I am a product of my experience

Oh why she chooses a wicked path
These are things I will never know
Like why she shows me so much wrath
Oh why oh why would she hate me so

Why will she not hear of my day
Nor strip her walls just for me
Why must she always be so far away
Never knowing how lucky is she

I will hold her until she knows
For I have read book after book
And I have digested enough prose
To know what should keep her hooked

If she would just listen she’d see
I am unlike every other
I am not selfish, so giving
I think so highly of my mother

She must change her ways at once
For I do not wish to see her bleed
Unless it is her time of the month
She will never find a tolerant one like me

For I have just found out who I am
And I will scream until she hears me
To make sure she understands
That I am no longer selfish you see

Oh don’t you see, I am kind
Unlike she who does nothing in return
She has not cured any ailment of mine
So alone time she has not earned
