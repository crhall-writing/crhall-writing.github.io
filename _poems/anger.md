why is she so angry  
where has her beauty gone  
why is she no longer intrigued    
now so wicked and so wrong   

others do it for me  
and do it with such grace  
so what is it about she  
oh why must she be so full of hate  

I am poor for I am lonely  
I am sad with no need for therapy  
for my mother would do it for me  
so what is missing in she  

oh she who is so cruel, now ugly  
much uglier than before is she  
for once she had face of beauty  
where is her sun-like personality   

she is now as any man  
any man that I despise  
she does not see me for who I am  
if only she’d open her eyes  

why does she no longer listen  
for I have been through so much more  
she must hear my experience  
her life has been too easy I’m sure  

oh but I, on the other hand  
have seen horrors and terrors unmatched  
ships through storms I have manned  
and by so many monsters been attacked  

I have finally figured out life  
I have been pushed far enough to learn  
I am knowing and I am right  
for my suffering has all been earned  

but never mind that all  
I know her anger has no reason  
my anger from standing so tall  
I am a product of my experience  

oh why she chooses a wicked path  
these are things I will never know  
like why she shows me so much wrath  
oh why oh why would she hate me so  

why will she not hear of my day  
nor strip her walls just for me  
why must she always be so far away  
never knowing how lucky is she  

I will hold her until she knows  
for I have read book after book  
and I have digested enough prose  
to know what should keep her hooked  

if she would just listen she’d see  
I am unlike every other  
I am not selfish, so giving  
I think so highly of my mother  

she must change her ways at once  
for I do not wish to see her bleed  
unless it is her time of the month  
she will never find a tolerant one like me  

for I have just found out who I am  
and I will scream until she hears me  
to make sure she understands  
that I am no longer selfish you see  

oh don’t you see, I am kind  
unlike she who does nothing in return  
she has not cured any ailment of mine  
so alone time she has not earned
