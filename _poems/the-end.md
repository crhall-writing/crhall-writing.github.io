I hate conclusions  
as a student in secondary school    
I refused to write one on each and every essay   
I was an entitled little shit, I know that well    

but I didn’t remember doing it for attention  
and certainly not laziness  
I left school every day  
to go to my night classes at the local community college  

sitting in a computer lab for three hours after a two hour lecture  
never wanting the night to end  
even when sleep was banging at the walls of my brain  
begging for something to give  

but I don’t want to ruminate on the finish line  
I won’t care to walk the aisle in a gown and cap  
I’m not proud or sad when something is done    
I’ve already forgotten and carried on
