(1)  
empty man   
you’ve met him once before  
or maybe hundreds of times  
as if words could replace   
empathy and compassion  
there’s a reason she  
doesn’t understand the references  
she cared not to read a single one  
I, like a fool, had read each one  
times enough to try connecting dots  
attach timelines, but all for naught  
each instance I brought one up  
was met with nothing more  
than, “I didn’t even know what  
it was I was writing about.”   
she was smart for not wasting  
energy reading meaningless  
prose and poetry, all coming from  
a man without a meaningful experience  
to his name  
it’s strange seeing someone write  
those written works not becoming  
like old friends who know you   
almost better than you know yourself  
carrying crumbs or even pieces   
of who you truly are  
in the most real and vulnerable of senses  
I noticed the embarrassment  
of realizing even I projected more meaning  
onto those empty works, from my own life  
how empty of a lifespan  
to form so empty a man  

(2)  
empty men  
I imagine see the reader   
as the proper carrier  
of the emotional burden of literature
