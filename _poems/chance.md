you wouldn’t have caught the fireflies  
had you not taken that wrong turn  
the warm breeze can open your eyes  

but you’ll never feel that way again  
chances can steal all you are  
and all you thought you’d be  

for hours we’d milk a dead horse  
what magic lay in those chats  
looking out into the marsh  
the one that’s drying up  

the surgeon never faced you  
shame doesn’t need a visual
