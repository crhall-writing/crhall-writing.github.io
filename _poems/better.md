you’re either getting better  
or  
you’re getting worse  
huh.  
why can’t they tell me  
maybe  
you’re getting better  
or  
you’re figuring out how to *be* better  
or  
you’re finding out what *makes* it worth it  
or  
you’re learning how to bleed  
without  
making everyone else bleed  
or  
you’re sometimes dancing without caring  
about  
how much you’ve progressed since 13  
or  
you’re drinking for days on end  
and then  
you’re sober for the next month  
or  
you think you’re in love one day  
and  
just as quickly but more quietly  
you  
don’t even remember their name  
or  
you walk out of the cinema  
with  
a new purpose in life  
that  
you forget about the next day  
or 
even when you’re getting worse  
still  
you are trying to get better
