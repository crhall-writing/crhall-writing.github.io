I sat across you and saw weakness  
hypocrisy at the way you choose  
you didn’t care for me ’til  
the moment I pulled away  
I’m sure somewhere in there  
you don’t see it like I do  
you see it like this,  
why would a man  
want something he can have?   
why would he give up the chase?   
why would he settle for consolation?   
you think after you’re done chasing  
I’d want to be your participation trophy?   
dude  
you hit on my friend right in front of me  
because you’d been single for eight hours  
“I didn’t know she had a boyfriend”  
and that makes it any better?  
and after all that  
you have the gall to wonder  
why it is I want space from you  
don’t take you seriously  
am off doing my own thing?  
“why are you treating me  
in this indifferent way?”  
oh, you mean the way  
you treated me  
before I made clear  
I’ve got adult things to do  
if you prefer Neverland  
whining for toys  
that you discard and break  
the moment you get them  
you’ve got not a single thought  
that i see as valid, important,  
or realistic. I see you as  
a small child. I don’t care  
that all your toys are smashed  
and you still want more  
you’ve gotten what you wanted  
now enjoy your prize, kiddo  
the unfortunate fun  
of no longer caring about you  
is the joy of running circles  
around you. everything you say  
so easily contradicted  
“I’ve never treated  
someone like this before  
I never would. trust me  
I never, ever would”  
“then why did you   
do it so easily to me?”  
“well—uh—I actually did it  
to every other girl, too”  
“so what happened  
to your pretend morality—  
your make-believe standards  
for your own behavior?”  
why do you insist I keep  
*our* private life private  
you’ve got no hesitation  
to embarrass *me* in public  
you really think it’s that important  
that *our* business is kept hidden  
you sure it’s not some self-admission  
that once others know about you—  
what you do behind the scenes—  
they’ll think less of you?  
why does it embarrass you so  
to know that they all know  
what it is you’ve been up to?   
does that not imply  
the very essence of you  
is something that beckons  
embarrassment?  
and after the storm was through  
after I ran circles around you  
you sat across from me  
telling me I verbally abused  
“I sure did.” my fault, it’s true  
finally, finally, he knows he’s due  
to give up on his quest  
“I still think we’d work together”  
God, you absolute fool  
is it not obvious to you  
after so much of your life lived  
that negatives don’t cancel  
two people mistreating each other  
isn’t an argument to keep going  
you can’t convince me that  
me acting poorly means now  
that you never did  
and that we would live   
happily ever after   
that universe isn’t real  
there’s no alternate reality  
where you acted well  
and likewise, there’s not one  
to save me either  
I don’t believe in fate  
but even I of little faith  
know so plainly and clearly  
one would’ve cared  
without needing me to pull away  
and we both know that didn’t happen  
that universe never existed
