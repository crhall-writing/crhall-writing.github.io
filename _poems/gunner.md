the worst thing a woman can do  
is refuse to give to a man  
what men will say  
women shouldn’t expect  

she’s done every dish  
every inch of laundry  
cleaned every surface  
perfected your quandaries  

like the knots she ties  
as you never learned   
any practical kinds  
only when climbing’s concerned   

to you, maybe  
your quickness to use others   
while never reciprocating   
makes you some kind of gunner  

to me,    
you're not clever enough   
to do the most basic of feats  
the bare, *barest* of minimums
