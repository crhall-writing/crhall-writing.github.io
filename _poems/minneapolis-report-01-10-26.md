out all day, first thing a bust  
airport shut down the ramp ‘cause of us    
then get back down there,  to the west side  
see if anything’s wrong at the restaurants you love  
then spot ‘em, the fuzz on west 7th, that long    
stretch of road past mickey’s, the diner you know  
better than your own desk you have at home  

frozen standoff in the snow  
you’d’ve lost your voice from the go  
if you didn’t do all that work, now a pro    
in stretching your voice skin-thin  
like the membrane on the drum he beats  
to keep the rhythm going, chants in the streets  
and each time a guy wants his car to fly  
through the crowd, they’ve got it all figured out  

we’ve been trained more in a single day   
than these fuckers in their whole métiers  
they don’t stand a chance against this salt    
they can’t even stand on the iced asphalt
