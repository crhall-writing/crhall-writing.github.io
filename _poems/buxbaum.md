when you know all you want  
is to see another succeed  
to be a seed  
of all the offering you’ve got  

being the subordinate  
the one needing to be helped  
but it’s the hand you’ve been dealt  
so, so young you are kept  

and you just need to break out  
to go and change the way of things  
but you know the conflict that brings  
in so many shades difficult to make out  

but you’ve never felt more whole  
than seeing the ones who show you  
what your efforts can amount to  
and, oh, the places they will go
