if I'd never felt lonely  
I suppose I'd never have gone with you   

to that bar beneath Santa Fe  
let you order for me    
the most peated scotch  
to ever assault my tongue  
smoke lingering  
like your eyes when I coughed   

you're the type of guy  
that made me realize hours after dusk   
it's my sunglasses still on  
making the drive to leave so difficult  

but back when we ate breakfast before dawn  
you told me of fans begging  
for you to renew a music career  
I knew, as soon as you started, it wasn't true  
but it was clear to me    
we had more in common than you'd think
