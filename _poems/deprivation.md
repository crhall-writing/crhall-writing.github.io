the soles of my sandals are always black  
I’m too attached to get another pair  
or maybe too cheap, until they’re worn through  
and the sand scrapes at my calloused heels  

and I smell the smells of life  
the sweet corpses mixed with putrid salt  
and I want to be involved, to be as stained  
as the crab carcass bobbing atop the waves  

and she breaks the silence, telling me  
with a natural sense of apathy  
that we’ve stayed in the sun too long  
and she’s squinted her eyes too many times  

we’ll grow ripples in our faces, she says  
and I nod along like this is our bond  
the price of shared womanhood, wondering  
how to best deprive ourselves for their gaze
