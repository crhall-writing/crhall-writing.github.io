it feels impossible   
to write a love story  
to say there is anything gained  
from the payoff of enemies-to-lovers  
or lusters-to-lovers  
or strangers-to-lovers  
or friends-to-lovers  
or whatever is in between  
I don’t think that gives meaning  
maybe it’s something   
that exists over there  
while the importance happens here  
and whether it’s present or not  
what happens here goes on regardless
