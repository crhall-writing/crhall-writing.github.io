I don’t know if my eyes will pop  
out of their sockets  
for the amount of times I’ve had  
to compensate for your existence  

my blood pressure rises  
and you still think it’s all about you  
people around are losing their heads  
just to coddle to your every whim  

do you ever feel bad?  
or do you think that  
would make a nick in your delusion  
about your persistence?
