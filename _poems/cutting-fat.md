cutting out the fat  
that stops you from  
being who you really are  
wanting what you really want  

it does a lot  

it feels a little wrong  
sometimes like a faux pas   
so selfish you must be  
to do something benefitting you  

finally telling her  
I’ve been a sponge   
soaking up your insecurities  
for much, much too long  

to tell him  
I can’t be your doll  
or an exhibit in your zoo  
to replace all that you lack  

to tell her  
I’ve been your punching bag  
to strike because the others  
are off at new universities now  

to tell him  
I’m not your mother  
or your therapist or just another  
girl you force to listen to your weeping 

to tell her  
I can’t say you’re right  
to want the worst I’ve seen  
because you’re too scared of being alone  

to tell him  
I’m not able to make sure  
that when you play stupid games  
you’ll avoid stupid prizes  

to tell her  
I can’t provide  
favors and accommodations  
when you won’t admit their origin  

to tell him  
I just won’t engage  
if you need to argue whenever  
you hear a word coming from me  

to tell her  
I can’t take criticism  
when you won’t give it  
to those who’ve never even helped  

to tell him  
I can’t do the impossible  
death will come eventually  
and I cannot lie and say it won’t
