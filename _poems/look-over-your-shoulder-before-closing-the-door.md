why are the little stories  
I made up in my mind  
so much more meaningful  
than when I had the real thing  

you reeled me in   
I remember being 21  
gutted, on my knees  
pretending you meant less to me  

like Marina and Ulay  
I never knew one could get there  
little did I know  
you were already there  

how could I ever live a full life  
with those experiences  
it already is too late  
I've missed those valuable times  

instead I had five years  
passing time with others here and there  
waiting until I saw you again  
you telling me you’d always wait  

I miss how I could tell you it all  
you never guilted me  
or made me feel lesser  
you were my best of friends  

how it felt when it was never over  
oh, it could never be  
you’d been there too long already  
you’d surely be there after the next one    

I remember the first day I saw you  
golden hair when all around was dead  
how cold I was and unprepared  
though I had just come from the tundra you know too well  

how taken aback I was  
knowing you shared so much of me already  
you knew all my old haunts  
I felt my entire life when you smiled  

fearing high tide in my faux leather shoes  
your hand was trapped   
in a glove ridiculously thick  
you said you couldn’t feel it anyway  

you fell on those icy streets  
down Franklin avenue  
they’re not good at salting there, I know  
your hand completely open, exposed  

you walked into that strip club  
the one I’ve seen before  
I'm sure that was the only time  
they had seen a guy like you  

you can’t feel it anymore, you said  
I took it in mine anyway  
clumsily working around your oversized glove  
clumsily walking through damp sand  

the tides coming in, we better go  
oh but can’t we stay longer  
he’s got an empire to start  
he needs to go build what you’ll never know  

you were so desperate to leave  
and I so desperate for you to stay  
I wished we could be forever within warm brick  
above the old and bustling restaurant  

with your little retro fridge  
your mountains of books never shelved  
your glasses just like mine  
though yours you got in Lyon  

how did someone with so much  
a genius beyond anyones doubt  
find me, decade juvenile  
anything whom to give your eyes  

like a father you guided  
but I felt the path was my own    
it meant so much to me  
how you’d stay up talking me through my fears  

--  

I was just passing time  
the memories of brick are just that  
understand it was a handful of times  
you’ve built that house with another  

half a decade spilled  
soiled the white carpet  
it wasn’t very clean in the first place  
but how it hurts to see the cup empty  

five years of life are dried and gone  
and you asked me if it were two or three  
just a small mistake, was just a number  
but we both know that you’re a professor  

you loved so much my art  
when you were the subject  
you loved it when I’d photograph you  
and I loved the way you loved it  

I loved drawing you, animating you, writing you  
and did you love the attention  
I’d never met someone who modeled like you  
and made me feel like a real artist  

I remember when they’d go days without seeing me  
I just wrote and wrote and wrote  
wrote like I hadn’t in years   
ink flowing just like my tears  

I wanted what we both knew you’d never give  
but I could never be angry at you  
these things happen all the time  
and you never meant anything by it  

even from afar  
no one mentored me the same  
you taught me so much more  
than I ever learned before  

I remember how warm the world was  
that when I said I loved you  
it also made you feel warm  
you’d say over and over, you felt so warm  

no longer some unachievable goal  
you saw me as I am  
you could reach out and touch me  
as I could you, not going right through  

--  

no one ever chased for me so long  
when I was getting over him  
I had no time  
you came and took me by my arm  

you called me every night  
told me you never stopped thinking of me  
told me you’d never get over me  
told me you got a chance to do it over  

that I was the best gift you’ve received  
that you didn’t want to waste more time  
but you waste time like it’s sport  
you have a PhD, after all  

sometimes I wonder how you were  
at my younger age  
though now I approach 29   
I still have some time  

did someone shatter you   
an older illusion?   
did you ever know someone  
who made you feel so small  

did you know someone who made the world change  
the moment they looked you in the eye  
made you feel proud of everything you’ve done  
that has led you to that feeling  

did you know someone who could take it all away  
the moment they forget   
how long they’ve known you  
did you ever go three days without eating  

did you ever write songs about someone  
did anyone ever mean enough  
even with her, all the way in Paris  
you talked like she meant nothing at all  

I wonder what you tell her about me  
did you ever say I was special to you  
or did you draw me like an outline  
you got what you needed; lights out let’s get to bed
