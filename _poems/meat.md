adrenaline's kicking in  
dead trees threaten  
to swallow you  
and your Honda Civic  
they reflect the headlights  
and if any small thing goes awry  
you think you'd maybe die  
until you stop seeing your disposition  
and start looking at its shadow  
the trees encase  
like ribs around a beating heart  
there's nothing like the raw meat  
the only one pumping blood
