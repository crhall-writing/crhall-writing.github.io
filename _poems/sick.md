I’m so sick  
of being told what I need to like  
and what I need to hate  
but I suppose that’s growing up  
understanding  
one person is waiting   
to tell you that author you admire  
is pretentious too much  
and they’re standing beside  
the man with a large grin  
punctuating through the spittle  
about how the ways you feel excited  
or silly or carefree or even haunted  
are not on the list they’ve concocted  
the one that’s never communicated  
outside the tiny circle bursting   
like a beached whale, plumes escaping  
being too close will leave you  
nauseous if not infected
