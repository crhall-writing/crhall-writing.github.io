I remember you told me   
you’re done with embarrassment   
you sent me a poem   
the point wasn’t lost on me   

how did it work out?   
I still feel embarrassed   
I don’t like when it happens   
but I love that it’s happened   

I cried and cried   
and croed and craid   
when my most common thought   
showed up in my dreams   

I didn't ask for it  
I promise I lived before it  
I'll go on after it  
but I'll always feel the same
