2:55am. 0255.  
times like these  

make you wish   
for a new zone  

desert darkness  
has no savior  

no distraction  
from vastness  

the mountains  
veiled for now  

but in the east  
dawn prevails  

and the waiting  
twists the knife  

lids drooping   
blasting AC  

and stereo  
hours to go  

and for you  
it’s finished  

I’m all done  
with waiting  

but muscle  
memorizes
