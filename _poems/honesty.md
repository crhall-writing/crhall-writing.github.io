I’ve spent  
my entire known life  
keeping secrets for this person  
or another  
all of which  
are just downright ridiculous  
“you are my favorite child”  
followed by immediate fury  
when I speak it to my brother  
and now I’m an adult  
trying to keep this researcher’s  
research secret from this other researcher  
pretending this person’s work is of any  
merit when it’s not, to save their face  
every man and every women  
and every one in-between  
wants me to keep  
the truth of how much they despise  
their significant other  
and all of their friends and families  
because leaving after so many years  
would be too inconvenient  
if you can’t be honest  
live in an honest way
